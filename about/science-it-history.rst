History of Science-IT
=====================

Our history explains how we are now, so here's a summary for those who
are interested.

2009: M-grid
------------

M-grid was funded as a Finnish Research Infrastructure (FIRI) project
by the Academic of Finland.  It provided funding for local university
HPC clusters and a collaboration to develop the configuration to run
them.  They were run together as a grid, where jobs submitted to one
cluster can also run on others.  This was the start of the **Triton
cluster**.

20xx: department collaboration
------------------------------

Eventually, M-grid grew and became a collaboration between several
departments, mainly Biomedical Engineering and Computational Science,
Information and Computer Science, and Applied Physics.  There was the
joint Triton resource, used by members of all departments.  This is
when the name **Science-IT** emerged.  Management was members of the
IT groups of the departments.

In 20xx, Triton hardware had grown enough that it moved to a machine
room run by CSC nearby.  This provided more reliability, and further
professionalization of all of the management.

During this time, Science-IT was still funded by FIRI, in the projects
"Finnish Grid Infrastructure" (FGI) and "Finnish Grid and Cloud
Infrastructure" (FGCI).  It provided continued growth, regular new
hardware, and most importantly a collaboration with other
universities and CSC.

Training was a part of Science-IT/FGI/FGCI from the beginning.
Courses began in earnest around 2015ish.  We began yearly "HPC
Kickstart" courses as well as a wide variety of other courses on
specialty topics.  Most were run by Aalto but all other university
affiliates in Finland were invited to attend.

2017ish: expanding the scope
----------------------------

Around 2017, there was a push towards expanded usability of the HPC
resources: now longer were they mainly focused on computational
experts, but were for a wider and wider audience.  This basically meant
thinking about usability some, expanding our documentation to make it
clear we wanted to support others, and so on.  This led to a
medium-term problem, where we found more people were trying to use the
cluster, but weren't fully prepared to do so.

Our solution was to, in 2020, start the **Research Software Engineer**
team.  These were dedicated people hired not as cluster admins, but to
help others with their work, however it may be.  This explicitly
included those who didn't come from computational fields.  This turned
out to be a winning idea, and we slowly.
