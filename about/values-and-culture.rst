Aalto SciComp values and culture
================================

As a team grows, it's useful to outline its values and the way it
works.  This is our team's attempt at that.



Core values
-----------

1. We are researchers who aren't academics.
2. University research needs more than papers to succeed and help society.
3. Superstar team and processes, not superstar people.
4. Radical openness.

Explanations:

(1) **We are researchers who aren't academics**.  Research is far more
    than publications.  We help round out the skillset that
    high-performing teams need, even if we aren't directly involved in
    publications.

(2) **University research needs more than papers to succeed and help
    society.**  Software, data, and general skills are important
    university impacts.  We recognize this and help to keep it going.

(3) **Superstar team and processes, not superstar people.**
    "Superstar" isn't a good term because it glorifies single things,
    but our society works because all the parts work together.  Even
    our team only works because it's a part of a broader university,
    national, and international ecosystem.  But still, if we have to
    say something is our "superstar", it's the way our team works
    together (people+processes), not any individual people.

4. **Radical openness.** We are open by design, there are few reasons
   to hide our work.  Something doesn't have to be perfect to be
   findable.  We also want to set good examples for the university
   community.



Cultural practices
------------------

a. Remote first so that everyone can participate.
b. Working at the speed and chaos of the research.
c. Garage binds all our work together.
d. Work is quite independent but we always help each other first.
e. Technology is harder than it should be.
f. Helping people use technology is hard.  We work hard to get good at it.
g. No private messages so we can work together.

Explanations:

(a) **Remote first so that everyone can participate.**  We are
    professionals in the middle of our careers.  We have many things
    going on besides work, which we need to allow people to work
    around.  All of our core activities should be attendable remotely,
    so that our team members will never have to choose between their
    personal life, health, etc. and taking part in the team.

    On the flip side, we understand the need for team connections and
    try to have good team-building and customer-interaction events,
    in-person and otherwise.

(b) **Working at the speed and chaos of the research.**  Research is
    fast-paced and agile.  We acknowledge this and try to work at that
    speed, getting stuff done at the right speed for research and
    development, even if it's not the perfect solution long-term.  We
    take these short-term lessons and work to make proper long-term
    solutions once the patterns emerge.  We can work this way because
    we are close to the research.

(c) **Garage binds all our work together.**  The :doc:`/help/garage`
    session is a time our team can come together to help others, but
    also help ourselves.  It allows us a time to chat with each other
    (internally) without having to book a meeting every time.  Garage
    attendance isn't required every day, but people should come when
    it makes sense.

(d) **Work is quite independent but we always help each other first.**
    Even though we work very independently, we are a team.  We should
    take the time to help each other first, since that keeps the whole
    team running smoothly.

(e) **Technology is harder than it should be.**  These days, computing
    is in every field (that's why we are here).  But computing is
    harder than it should be: there is so much stuff to learn, user
    interfaces can be so esoteric, and there are so many different
    paths to people's final goals.  We acknowledge this and support
    users where and how they are.  We should never blame users for not
    knowing enough, but blame the technology for being so difficult to
    use.

(f) **Helping people use technology is hard.  We work hard to get good
    at it.**  Continuing from the above, it takes skill to help others
    with technology.  It's easy to fall into traps of user-blaming or
    getting frustrated.  We need intentional effort and practice to be
    the best supporters we can be.

(g) **No private messages so we can work together.**  It's easy to
    think "this is just noise, I will send private messages".  But
    that means that only a few people can answer and no one else
    learns the solutions.  Use public channels to ask generic
    questions instead of choosing a recipient and asking them.  Zulip
    chat is good at organizing lots of information without a person
    needing to read everything.  Of course, purely personal matters
    like absences, one-on-one meetings, continuing one-on-one work, is
    quite fine by private message.
