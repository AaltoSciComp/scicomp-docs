========================================
Remote Jupyter Notebook on shell servers
========================================

.. seealso::

   We now have a :doc:`General use student/teaching JupyterHub
   <jupyterhub>` installation which may serve your uses more simply.

Here we describe how you can utilise Aalto computing resources for Jupyter Notebook remotely. The guide is targeted for UNIX users at the moment.

Aalto provides two “light computing” servers: ``brute.org.aalto.fi``, ``force.org.aalto.fi``. We demonstrate how to launch a Jupyter Notebook on ``brute`` and access it on your laptop.

  < System activity on Brute >


.. code-block:: bash

	ssh username@brute.org.aalto.fi

	# Create your Kerberos ticket
	kinit

	# Create a session. I use tmux
	tmux

	# Load the Aalto Scicomp python environment
	module load scicomp-python-env

	# Create your env
	conda create -n env-name python=3.6 jupyter

	# Activate your python environment
	source activate env-name

	# Launch jupyter notebook in headless mode and a random port number
	jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=12520

.. note::

	You might get messages like ``The port 12520 is already in use, trying another port`` while starting the notebook server. In that case, take note of the port the server is running in, e.g.::

            [I 15:42:14.187 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
            [I 15:42:14.187 NotebookApp] http://localhost:12470/?token=kjsahd21n9...

	and replace "12520" below with the correct port number, 12470 in this case.

Now back to your laptop

.. code-block:: bash

	# Forward the port
	ssh -L 12520:localhost:12520 -N -f -l username brute.org.aalto.fi

Now launch your browser and go to http://localhost:12520 with your token.
