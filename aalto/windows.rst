=============
Aalto Windows
=============

This page describes the Aalto centrally-managed Windows computers,
where login is via Aalto accounts.  If you have a standalone laptop
(login not using Aalto account), some of this may be relevant, but for
the most part you will access your data and Aalto resources via
:doc:`remoteaccess`.

Basics
------

In the Aalto installations, login is via Aalto account only.

- You must be on the Aalto network the first time you connect.

Full disk encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aalto Windows laptops come with this by default, tied to your login
password.  To verify encryption, find "BitLocker" from the start menu
and check that it is on.

Note, that on standalone installations, you can do encryption by
searching "TrueCrypt" in programs - it is already included.


Data
----

This section details built-in ways of accessing data storage
locations.  For generic ways of accessing remotely, see
:doc:`remoteaccess`.  For Aalto data storage locations, see
:doc:`aaltostorage` and :doc:`aaltodata`.

Your home directory is automatically synced to some degree.

You can store local data at
``C:\LocalUserData\User-data\<yourusername>``.  Note that this is not
backed up or supported.  For data you want to exist in a few years,
use a network drive.  It can be worth making a working copy here,
since it can be faster.



Software
--------

Aalto software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a `Windows software self-service portal
<https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/self-service-portal-for-requesting-windows-software-installations>`__
which can be used to install some software automatically.

Installing other software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install most other software, you need to apply for a workstation
admin (``wa``) account.  Contact your department IT to get the process
started.
