   This is the initial intro of the kickstart course.  The old one at
   /training/scip/summer-kickstart/intro can be removed eventually

SciComp kickstart intro
=======================


Who are we?
-----------

* Aalto Scientific Computing: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/about/
* In collaborations with other universities (Finnish Computing
  Competence Infrastructure)
* And one talk in collaboration with CSC
* And occassionally talks in cooperation with other partners.



What is this course?
--------------------

Course contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Day 1

  * General big-picture stuff about high-performance computing
  * Some practical skills
  * Mostly lectures and demos
  * Quite generic

* Days 2 and 3

  * Using a computer cluster
  * Aalto's cluster as an example, but applicable to others.
  * Much more hands-on


Who is attending?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Multiple universities, with *different clusters*
* Our demos based on Aalto University

  * May need adapting to other sites
  * We will carefully explain about how things change in other sites.
  * You can ask questions about other universities (and get help during
    exercise sessions).



Practicalities
--------------


How the workshop works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When some people teach online, they can reach a few tens of people at
once.  We can reach hundreds.

We have an interesting strategy:

- Livestream broadcast, like a TV production.
- Anyone can watch.
- There are pauses for exercises, you can work (alone or in groups).
- If you want, be in Zoom and switch there for exercise sessions.

There are many parts of the workshop:

- Talking and demos (livestream)
- Type-along (livesteam)
- Exercises (Zoom or alone or your own groups)
- Breaks, at least 10 minutes/hour


Chat and communication
----------------------

- Please don't use the Zoom/Twitch chat for questions: insturctors won't see.

- Use the "Notes" for chat: questions in bullet points:

  .. image:: https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--questions2.png
     :alt: View and edit modes at top

- From here you can also find important links and reference.

- You can switch between view and edit modes:

  .. image:: https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--controls.png
     :alt: View and edit modes at top

  - You have to switch to edit mode once to get live updates (then you
    can go back to view)
  - Please leave in view mode if you aren't actively using it

- Someone watches these and will answer or raise relevant questions by
  voice.

- Don't get overloaded!  The point is you can read later.

- **Don't include names or identifies in the Notes: it is public.**

**Icebreaker: Please answer the icebreaker question in the Notes**


Where do you focus?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is so much information!  What should we look?

- **Screenshare and lecture**
- **Your own type-along**
- **Notes (all important links should be pasted here)**

  - Only look at the bottom.
  - Come back and read detailed answers later, not during.

- Lesson webpage (as needed, direct links in the Notes)


Screen arrangement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arranging your screen is surprisingly difficult!

We share a vertical window, so half of the screen is for us, and
half is for demos.

We are accessible to many learning styles
-----------------------------------------

- We have more material than we can cover, but...

- Not everyone needs to take the same path

  - Some may prefer to watch passively and self-study later
  - Some may be active in all the exercises
  - Some may leave it on in the background and pay attention when
    things sound interesting.
  - Some may miss a part and review videos later that evening.

- Our material is constantly being improved

  - This is more like a guided overview of our actual tutorials than a
    standalone course.
  - You can help us improve.



Care for the community
----------------------

Be respectful and helpful
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is actually hard to teach and mentor for tech like this.  The
course is much more than "only" instructors..

We leave you with four pieces of advice for now:

- **Everyone here is at different levels, and that's expected.**
  Everyone will be learning different things, and everyone will focus
  on different topics.  Passive learning is OK.
- **Everyone is both a teacher and a learner.**  If not now, after the
  course when you are helping others.
- **Take time to check in.** For example, ask "how's it going? is
  everyone getting what they need?", in breakout rooms.
- **When something isn't going right, speak up (or Notes write) quickly**.
  We want to help, even if the answer is "let's discuss later".


What can go wrong
-----------------

You get overloaded with information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Don't worry!
* Change your watching style and know material will be available for you to watch later.
* Instant video replays help here, but the material is also open.

Notes are too fast to follow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  Don't follow it. It's published for future reference.
*  Only look at the bottom during the sessions. Review later.
*  Write your question and come back to it later.

The notes lag and you can't edit / text goes wrong
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  This sometimes happens with high load
*  We recently upgraded but it could still happen.
*  Everyone: Switch to "view mode" and wait for it to calm down.
*  The real solution is that we (the staff) need to keep it shorter -
   we will move older data to an "Notes archive".

We don't have time to cover everything
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* This is just a fact - sorry.
* We aim to give a summary, you are smart enough to follow up later
* You can review later
* Talk with collaborators and make your own study network

We deviate from the schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* We try to stay on track
* But this is going to happen

There are major accessibility problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* e.g. audio quality is bad, screen not visible, breaks not coming,
  unintelligble explanation...
* Write the problem in the bottom of the Notes immediately.

The stream suddenly dies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Broadcaster's computer has crashed.
* Stay around and it will resume in about 5 minutes.

You don't yet have some important software installed or configured
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Oops... but it's OK
* Switch to "watching" mode and once the day is over, work on fixing it for the next day.
* Ask for help if needed

You can't attend every day
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Review material later, raw Twitch video delay is ready immediately.
* Better YouTube videos later

A cat visits one of the instructors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* How is this a problem?

The course is too cool and you want to know more
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Check out our advanced information
* Ask your local supporters



Final notes
-----------

Recording
~~~~~~~~~

- The course is recorded and will be put on YouTube
- But because of our unique setup, you *can't possibly* be recorded
  yourself.
- Don't add names in the Notes.  Don't post any personal information.
- All outputs, including the Notes, are CC-BY and published.


Credits
~~~~~~~

- We don't assign credits for attending this course - we can't track
  attendance.
- Use what you learn here in the online course Hands-on Scientific
  Computing (https://hands-on.coderefinery.org) to get credits.


Join us!
~~~~~~~~

We are staff at Aalto but welcome others to join us in allowing
everyone to do scientific computing.

More on this later.
