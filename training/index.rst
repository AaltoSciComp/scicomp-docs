Training
========

Scientific computing and data science require special, practical
skills in programming and computer use.  However, these aren't often
learned in academic courses.  This page is your portal for getting
these skills.  The focus is practical,
hands-on courses for scientists, not theoretical academic courses.

Scientific Computing in Practice
================================

SCIP is a lecture series at Aalto University which covers hands-on,
practical scientific computing related topics. Lectures are open for
the entire Aalto community as well as our partners at FGCI
consortium.


Examples of topics covered at different lectures: HPC crash course,
Triton kickstarts, Linux Shell, Parallel programming models: MPI and
OpenMP, GPU computing, Python for scientists, Data analysis with R
and/or Python, Matlab, HTCondor and many others.

Skills map
==========

There is a lot to learn, and it all depends on each other.  How do you
get started?

Our training map `Hands-on Scientific Computing
<https://hands-on.coderefinery.org>`__ sorts the skills you need
by level and category, providing you a strategy to get started.

.. image:: /images/levels.svg
   :align: center
   :alt: Level dependencies
   :scale: 75%

In order to do basic scientific computing, C (Linux and shell) is
needed.  To use a computer cluster, D (Clusters and HPC) is useful.  E
(scientific coding) is useful if you are writing your own software.
