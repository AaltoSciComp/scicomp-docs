   * More details will be updated soon.



Part of :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice <index>` lecture series
at Aalto University, in partnership with `CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`__
and `Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (NRIS) <https://www.sigma2.no/nris>`__.

This is a medium-advanced course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It is suitable for people who have a basic
understanding of basic Python and want to know some internals and
important libraries for science.  Read the `learner personas <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#learner-personas>`__ to
see if the course is right for you

`Prerequisites
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#prerequisites>`__
include basic programming in Python.



Practical information
---------------------

This is an online course streamed via Twitch (the
`CodeRefinery channel <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>`__) so that
anyone may follow along without registration. You do *not* need a
Twitch account.  There is a HackMD link
(collaborative edited notes) which is used for asking questions during
the course.  If you would like to attend for to get live help and do
exercises, you may register via one of the links below (this is highly
recommended!).  The `actual material is here
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/>`__.

**Instructors and organizers:**

* Richard Darst (Aalto Scientific Computing)

**Time, date, place:** the course consists of four online hands-on
sessions 3h each.  All times EEST (`convert 9:50 to your timezone
<https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2021-10-25/9:50>`__).
**Schedule is tentative**, we may run earlier or later.  Join 10-20
minutes early if attending a single lesson.

- (week before) **Installation help sessions** (for sites that offer
  them)
- **Please connect to all sessions 10 minutes early**: icebreakers and
  intro already starts then.

**Registration:** If you are from Finland `please register here <>`__.
While the stream is available for everyone, if you register
you can get HackMD access for asking questions and will support
our funding by contributing to our attendance statistics.

**Credits:** Certificates are not provided for this course.

Preparation
-----------

`Prerequisites include basic programming in Python
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#prerequisites>`__.

**Preparation:** Online workshops can be a productive format, but it
takes some effort to get ready.  Browse these resources:

* `Attending a livestream workshop
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-stream/>`__,
  good to read in detail.
* `How to use HackMD to take answer questions and hold discussions <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/>`__.
* It is useful to `watch <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__ or `read
  <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/>`__ the Linux shell crash
  course, since these basic command line concepts are always useful.

Software installation:

* See the `installation page of the course material
  <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/installation/>`__.

  * In principle, if you are at Aalto, the service
    https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi should be sufficient to do most of
    this course without any local installations.  Perhaps not
    everything, but it will be OK for most people.

* `Zoom <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/>`__, if you
  are registered for one of the exercise sessions.



Community standards
-------------------

This is a large course, and we will have many diverse groups attending
it.  There will be people attending at all different levels, from
"just learned Python" to "been using Python for a while and want to
see some tips and tricks".  Everyone will choose their own path, some
people will be more hands-on or more "watching".  Everyone is be both
a teacher and a learner.  Even our instructors are always learning
things and make mistakes (and this is part of the point!).  Please
learn from our mistakes, too!

This course consists of both lectures, hands-on exercises, and demos.
It is designed to have a range of basic to advanced topics: there
should be something for everyone.

The main point this course is the exercises.  If you are with a group,
we hope people to work together and help each
other.  We expect everyone to help each other as best as they can with
respect for different levels of knowledge - at the same time be aware
of your own limitations.  No one is better than anyone else, we just
have different existing skills and backgrounds.

If there is anything wrong, *tell us* - HackMD is best.  If you need to contact us
privately, you can message the host on Zoom, instructor chat is via
`CodeRefinery chat <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/>`__,
and by email contact `CodeRefinery support
<https://coderefinery.org/>`__. This could be as simple as "speak
louder / text on screen is unreadable" or someone is creating a
harmful learning environment.
