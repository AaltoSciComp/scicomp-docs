Oct 2020 / Data analysis workflows
===============================================

Part of the `Scientific Computing in Practice <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/index.html>`__ lecture series at Aalto University.

**Audience:** Researchers who are using or will soon be using R and Python
for data analysis, who know how to program with these languages, but do not
necessarily know what are the best practices for data analysis.
The course material is available in both R and Python, but this
is not a course on the basics of scientific programming. If you wish to
prep up your scientific programming skills, we recommend taking
our :doc:`../scip/python-for-scicomp`-course.  Key topics include:

- Data analysis workflows
- Data preparation
- Modeling
- Scaling


This doesn't teach programming or data analysis, but the skills you
need to do that well.  If you are interested in Python for science
skills, look at our :doc:`../scip/python-for-scicomp`-course.

**About the course:** We provide a practical introduction and advice
for data analysis in R and Python. We will learn how you should organize
your data for efficient data analysis, how to analyze the data, how to
split your data/models based on your intended data analysis task,
and how to visualize the results you obtain from this data analysis.
The course is suited for people who are starting on doing data analysis
and would like to start on a good workflow. The course material can be
done with either R or Python.

Course consists of four three hour sessions that will be done online
via zoom. In these sessions we'll learn of core concepts of data analysis.
We will do some exercises during the sessions, but most of the exercises
will be available throught a GitHub repository (released a bit later)
and are meant to be done between the sessions. We will go through the
solutions at the start of each session.
