.. admonition:: News and Important info

   * We are updating the content for this year's run. 
   * `Course material <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/>`__
   * Last year run on `YouTube
     <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZLVmS9rf3nMWEKWtagJ6h0q9BrFO49tn>`__


This is a medium-advanced course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It is suitable for people who know basic
Python and want to understand some internals and important libraries for
science - basically, how a typical scientist actually uses Python.

Practical information
---------------------

.. admonition:: Registration

   `General registration: please register here <https://link.webropol.com/ep/pfsc25>`__

This is an online course streamed via Twitch (the
`CodeRefinery channel <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>`__) so that
anyone may follow along without registration. You do *not* need a
Twitch account.  There is a collaborative notes link which is used for asking questions during
the course. The `actual material is here
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/>`__.

While the stream is available even without providing personal data, if
you register you may get collaborative notes access for asking questions and will
support our funding by contributing to our attendance statistics.


Schedule
--------
The course consists of three online hands-on
sessions 4h each with lunch break in between.  All times EET (`convert 9:50 to your timezone
<https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2025-11-25/9:50>`__).
**The schedule is tentative**, we may run earlier or later, so join early
if attending a single lesson.

.. warning::

   **Timezones!** Times in this page in the Europe/Helsinki timezone.
   **In Central Europe, the course starts at 8:50!** (`convert 9:50

Preparation
-----------

`Prerequisites include basic programming in Python
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#prerequisites>`__.


**Software installation:**

* See the `installation page of the course material
  <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/installation/>`__.

  * In principle, if you are at Aalto, the service
    https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi should be sufficient to do most of
    this course without any local installations.  Perhaps not
    everything, but it will be OK for most people.


**Mental preparation:** Online workshops can be a productive format, but it
takes some effort to get ready.  Browse these resources:

* `Attending a livestream workshop
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-stream/>`__,
  good to read in detail.
* `How to use HackMD to take answer questions and hold discussions <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/>`__.
* It is useful to `watch <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__ or `read
  <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/>`__ the Linux shell crash
  course, since these basic command line concepts are always useful.



Credits
------- 

It is possible to obtain a certificate from the course with
a little extra work. The certificate is equivalent to 1 ECTS and your study
supervisor will be able to register it as a credit in your university study
credit system. Please make sure that your supervisor/study program accepts it.

Learners with a valid Aalto student number will automatically get the credit
registered in Aalto systems.

To obtain a certificate/credit, we expect you to have registered to the course by 7/11/2024, 
follow the 4 sessions and provide us with at least the following 5 documents via email
(1 text document, 3 or more python scripts/notebooks). **Please remember to add your name and surname to all submitted files. If you are a student at Aalto University, please also add your student number.**

- **1 text document** (PDF or txt or anything for text): For each of the 3 days, write a short paragraph (learning diary) to highlight
  your personal reflections about what you have found useful, which topic inspired
  you to go deeper, and more in general what you liked and what could be improved.
- **3 (or more) .py scripts/notebooks**: For each of the 3 days take one code example from the 
  course materials and make sure you can run it locally as a ".py" script or as a jupyter notebook.
  Modify it a bit according to what inspires you: adding more comments, testing the
  code with different inputs, expanding it with something related to your field of
  research. There is no right or wrong way of doing this, but please submit a
  python script/notebook that we are eventually able to run and test on our local computers.

These 4 (or more) documents should be sent before 30/November/2024 23:59CET to scip@aalto.fi.
If the evaluation criteria are met for each of the 4 (or more) documents, you will receive
a certificate by end of December 2024. Please note that we do not track course attendance and if you missed one
session, recordings will be available on Twitch immediately after the streaming ends.

Community standards
-------------------

This is a large course, and we will have many diverse groups attending
it.  There will be people attending at all different levels, from
"just learned Python" to "been using Python for a while and want to
see some tips and tricks".  Everyone will choose their own path, some
people will be more hands-on or more "watching".  Everyone is be both
a teacher and a learner.  Even our instructors are always learning
things and make mistakes (and this is part of the point!).  Please
learn from our mistakes, too!

This course consists of both lectures, hands-on exercises, and demos.
It is designed to have a range of basic to advanced topics: there
should be something for everyone.

The main point this course is the exercises.  If you are with a group,
we hope people to work together and help each
other.  We expect everyone to help each other as best as they can with
respect for different levels of knowledge - at the same time be aware
of your own limitations.  No one is better than anyone else, we just
have different existing skills and backgrounds.

If there is anything wrong, *tell us* - HackMD is best.  If you need to contact us
privately, you can message the host on Zoom, instructor chat is via
`CodeRefinery chat <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/>`__,
and by email contact `CodeRefinery support
<https://coderefinery.org/>`__. This could be as simple as "speak
louder / text on screen is unreadable" or someone is creating a
harmful learning environment.


Code of Conduct
---------------
We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching,
