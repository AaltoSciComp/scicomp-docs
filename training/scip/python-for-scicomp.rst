   * If you are not from any of these, or you respective country's
     registration is full, you may still watch for free, without
     registration, at https://twitch.tv/coderefinery.  Or, `register on
     the Finland form <https://forms.gle/8ez7eEjv3pty2DWh9>`__ as "I will only follow the stream via Twitch.tv
     and do the exercises by myself" to get email updates.
   * If you want to host your own Zoom exercises sessions making use
     of our livestream, you may contact us (`CodeRefinery chat
     <https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com>`__ or scip -at- aalto.fi) to
     coordinate.

Part of :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice <index>` lecture series
at Aalto University, in partnership with `CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`__
and `Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (NRIS) <https://www.sigma2.no/nris>`__.

This is a medium-advanced course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It is suitable for people who have a basic
understanding of basic Python and want to know some internals and
important libraries for science.  Read the `learner personas <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#learner-personas>`__ to
see if the course is right for you

`Prerequisites
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#prerequisites>`__
include basic programming in Python.



Practical information
---------------------

This is an online course streamed via Twitch (the
`CodeRefinery channel <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>`__) so that
anyone may follow along without registration.  There is a HackMD link
(collaborative edited notes) which is used for asking questions during
the course.  If you would like to attend for to get live help and do
exercises, you may register via one of the links below (this is highly
recommended!).  The `actual material is here
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/>`__.

**Instructors and organizers:**

* Richard Darst, Aalto Scientific Computing **(organizer)**
* ... and many more.

**Time, date, place:** the course consists of four online hands-on
sessions 3h each.  All times EEST (`convert 10:00 to your timezone
<https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2021-10-25/10:00>`__), and
program is tentative:

- (week before) **Installation help session**
- Mon 25.oct, 10:00-13:00 (Jupyter, numpy, matplotlib)
- Tue 26.oct, 10:00-13:00 (scripts, packaging)
- Wed 27.oct, 10:00-13:00 (scipy, pandas)
- Thu 28.oct, 10:00-13:00 (library ecosystem, dependencies, Binder)
- **Please connect to all sessions 10 minutes early**: icebreakers and
  intro already starts then.

**Registration:** `Click here to register <https://forms.gle/8ez7eEjv3pty2DWh9>`__.
If you are from Norway, `please register here <https://skjemaker.app.uib.no/view.php?id=11270960>`__.
If you are from Sweden, `please register here <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdte5EQYJonddYPDtby6D6YKtJ38oEyQ6lgkBUkJGHl4MS1Qg/viewform?usp=pp_url>`__.
While the stream is available for everyone, if you register
you can get HackMD access for asking questions and will support
our funding by contributing to our attendance statistics.

**Credits:** Certificates are not provided for this course.

Preparation
-----------

`Prerequisites include basic programming in Python
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#prerequisites>`__.

**Preparation:** Online workshops can be a productive format, but it
takes some effort to get ready.  Browse these resources:

* `Attending a livestream workshop
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-stream/>`__,
  good to read in detail.
* `How to use HackMD to take answer questions and hold discussions <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/>`__.
* It is useful to `watch <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__ or `read
  <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/>`__ the Linux shell crash
  course, since these basic command line concepts are always useful.

Software installation:

* See the `installation page of the course material
  <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/installation/>`__.

  * In principle, if you are at Aalto, the service
    https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi should be sufficient to do most of
    this course without any local installations.  Perhaps not
    everything, but it will be OK for most people.

* `Zoom <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/>`__, if you
  are registered for one of the exercise sessions.



Community standards
-------------------

This is a large course, and we will have many diverse groups attending
it.  Everyone will be both a teacher and a learner and help to make
the course successful.  Since this is a large and interactive course
which we are just now prototyping, there will be some rough edges and
not everything will go perfectly.  Please learn from our mistakes,
too!

This course consists of both lectures, hands-on exercises, and demos.
It is designed to have a range of basic to advanced topics: there
should be something for everyone.

The main point this course is the exercises, and they will happen in
breakout rooms where we expect people to work together and help each
other.  We expect everyone to help each other as best as they can with
respect for different levels of knowledge - at the same time be aware
of your own limitations.  No one is better than anyone else, we just
have different existing skills and backgrounds.

If there is anything wrong, *tell us* - if you need to contact us
privately, you can message the host on Zoom or :doc:`contact us
outside the course </help/index>`.  This could be as simple as "speak
louder / text on screen is unreadable" or someone is creating a
harmful learning environment.
