Oct 2019 / Introduction to distributed computing with HTCondor
==============================================================

Part of `Scientific Computing in Practice <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/index.html>`__ lecture series at Aalto University.

**Audience:** Employees and students looking for an extensive intro into high-throughput computing.

**About the course:** HTCondor is a framework for distributed computing, utilizing the idle CPU time on Aalto Linux workstations. This course consists of a basic introduction to Condor and a tutorial for running serial and parallel applications on the department Condor network. Course consists of two 2h tutorials, first day is an introduction to HTCondor basics, and the other day advanced techniques like checkpointing, running MATLAB app and ASCOT implementation as an example.

To get some details of the high-throughput computing, take a look at `What is HTCondor? <https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/description.html>`__
