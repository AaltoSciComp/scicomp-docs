Git

Git is a version control system. This page collects various Git
tutorials and resources

Version control systems track changes to files. This means that as you
are working on your projects (code, LaTex, notes, etc), you can track
history. This means that you can see former history, and collaborate
better. Using one for at least for code should probably be one of the
minimum standards of computational research.

"*Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle
everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast
performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and
ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging
areas, and multiple workflows.*" `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_


.. note::

   * This page is git in general, not Aalto specific.

   * :doc:`aalto/git <../aalto/git>` contains advice on the Aalto
     Gitlab, a repository for the Aalto community integrated to Aalto systems.


Basic git tutorials
===================

-  There is an `interactive git tutorial <https://try.github.io/>`_ from
   codeschool and github. Good for your first use.
-  Software carpentry has a `good
   tutorial <https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>`_ focused on
   researchers.
-  Gitlab
   `cheatsheet <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/blob/master/design/print/git-cheatsheet/print-pdf/git-cheatsheet.pdf>`_.

More references
===============

-  You can search for many tutorials online.
-  `software-carpentry.org <https://software-carpentry.org>`_ (an
   organization that teaches development to scientists) has a very good
   `tutorial
   online <https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>`_.
-  The book "`Pro Git <https://git-scm.com/book/>`_" is online.

   -  Read chapters 1-3 for a good introduction to using git for your
      own projects.
   -  Read chapter 5 for a good introduction to using git to collaborate
      with others.

-  There's a `somewhat official documentation
   place <https://git-scm.com/doc>`_ - including videos.
-  There is an `official
   tutorial <https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial>`_ but it is probably
   too theoretical.
-  All git commands have very good but very detailed manual pages - type
   ``man git COMMAND`` or ``git help COMMAND`` to see them.
-  `Interactive git
   cheatsheet <https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html>`_. (very
   good once you know the basics)
- `A Visual Git Reference
  <http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html>`_

Other hosting services
======================

Realistically, use version.aalto.fi for most projects related to Aalto
research, and Github if you want to make something open-source with a
wider community (but you can also make open repos in Aalto Gitlab,
just harder for random people to contribute).  For non-work private
repos, you have to make your own choice.

* Github is a proprietary commercial service, but extremely popular.
  It can allow personal private repositories and there is an option
  to apply for a "pro" account with your university email as part of
  their `GitHub Education <https://github.com/education>`__ program.

* Bitbucket is also somewhat popular, limit of free 5 private repositories
  (but you can pay for more).

* Gitlab.com is a commercial service but makes the open-source Gitlab
  edition.  Gitlab.com offers unlimited private repositories.

* `source.coderefinery.org <https://source.coderefinery.org>`_ is
  another Gitlab hosted by the Coderefinery project, a pan-Nordic
  academic group.  It might be useful if you have a very distributed
  project, but realistically for Aalto projects, use Aalto gitlab.


Git installation and configuration
==================================

If you are planning to use git version control and you do not have it in your system, you can check the `git installation instructions on CodeRefinery webpages <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git-in-terminal/#git-in-the-terminal>`__. Please note that in some windows systems managed by organisations (for example Aalto Windows) the default HOME for git (git bash) is on a drive that is NOT local (e.g. ``Z:\``). This can be an issue if you want to use git when the internet connection is not reliable, you can make sure your system uses another folder as ``$HOME`` by editing the global file "profile" which is usually found in "C:\Program Files\Git\etc" and add a line such as ``export HOME="/c/Users/<username>/"`` near the top of the file.
