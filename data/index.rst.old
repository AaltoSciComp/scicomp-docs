Data
====

Data binds all of today's research together.  Even if you don't consider
yourself to do data-based research, the results of your work becomes
data before it is published.  The highest levels of funding
agencies are beginning to demand good data management and openness.
Knowing how to manage data is probably one of the most important
untaught modern skills.

It's not just "get it done": there are good and bad methods of managing
data.  For example,

* A **bad strategy** is to store everything in one folder on your own
  laptop: there's a very high chance that you will someday lose it all.
  A **better strategy** is to use a secure centralized service - preferably
  an Aalto service, since you get guaranteed support for free.

* A **bad strategy** is for everyone to do their own thing and put no effort
  into recording what they have done: in five years, when the group is
  almost completely changed, that data will be unusable.  A **better
  strategy** is to make sure things are documented and archived as soon
  you get them (and keep this up to date), so that the data can continue
  to serve you in the future.

* A **bad strategy** is to assume all data is proprietary Aalto information:
  eventually funders will demand more and you won't be prepared, and
  Aalto will remain an island, instead of a hub that others want to work
  with and build on.  A **better strategy** is to always consider openness,
  licensing, and privacy from the start (even if you don't do it right
  away), and always separate data based on level of confidentiality so
  that you can share or open later.

here we focus on the practical side of things.

Applying for funding
====================

When applying for funding, you may need to submit a **data management
plan (DMP)** along with the grant application.  For hints on making
one, see our :doc:`data management plan <plans>` page or the `Aalto
Research Data Management pages`__..  However, be aware that a grant
application data management plan ("Funder DMP") usually focuses on
sounding like a grant, not being a usable work plan ("Practical DMP").
Before you start accumulating data, browse the other links on this
site and make sure that you organize things well!  Aalto info will
only help you make a funder DMP, not organize your data during the
project.

Grantwriters and the Open Science and ACRIS teams can
help you with producing data management plans for funding.  Science-IT
can help you with funding or practical data management plans.

During the project
==================

Make sure that you manage data well - just think, your data is
possibly worth more than all your other devices combined.  Check out
the core lessons corelessons (non here yet) to learn of the most common
problems, and see if any of them apply to you.

You may want to read our :doc:`welcome to researchers
<../aalto/welcomeresearchers>` and :doc:`outline of data management at
Aalto <principles>` pages.  For specific Aalto storage
services, see :doc:`aalto-details`, and for other options see
the :doc:`general services page <services>`.

We recommend that each project or group gets a network drive, which is
used as the centralized place for data storage, safekeeping, and
possibly daily work.  See the :doc:`outline of data management at
Aalto <principles>` page.





Internal reporting
==================

Data is a top-level research output, even if not everyone considers it
valuable now.  Open or not, the university wants to know what data
exists.  Currently, this is done via `ACRIS
<https://acris.aalto.fi/>`__ (`primary instructions
<https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/ACRIShelp/ACRIShelp>`__).  In
particular, you should create a "dataset" object for data you create
(it doesn't have to be open).  For some hints, for now see the :doc:`ACRIS
point on the services page <services>` or the `ACRIS instructions on
data <https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/register-your-dataset-or-software-in-acris>`__.



Sharing and collaboration
=========================

Obviously, you will often need to share data within projects.
Emailing things back and forth is rarely a good way to do things.
Check other data sharing services from :doc:`our services page
<services>`, `What file storage to use?
<https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/what-file-storage-to-use-when>`__,
or `Aalto's IT services for research
<https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/it-services-for-research>`__ pages.

We recommend, instead of seeing this as a sharing problem, see this as
a storage problem: find a place to store data which everyone can
access, and share via that.  This promotes long-term organization.



Archival after the project
==========================

After a project is done, you may need to store data long-term for
follow-up use.  You *shouldn't* do this just by assuming everyone
keeps their copy: people leave, and eventually that a data will get
lost.  The easiest and recommended way of doing this is by opening
data and publishing it on a reputable worldwide archive once it is
time.  For the most part, the university wants to avoid creating its
own internal permanent archives, because they will end up requiring
large effort to maintain.  It's better to use the publicly-funded
and managed worldwide services.



Publication
===========

See our list of :doc:`storage services <services>` for recommendations
on archival.  If you don't know what to pick (there isn't something
specialized for your field), use Zenodo and report it in ACRIS (see
"internal reporting" above).



Licensing and intellectual property
===================================

Just because data is "out there" doesn't mean it's usable by others:
big companies have ensured that data is by default closed.  Luckily,
it is easy to make data reusable: just add a license.  There are
plenty of options that can balance between "public domain, do
anything" and "if you help us too".

See our :doc:`Open Source page <../aalto/opensource>` for more info.
