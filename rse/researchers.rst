For researchers and research groups
===================================

You program or analyze data in your daily work, and you know something is missing:
your code and data is less organized, less efficient, less managed than others,
and it's affecting the quality of your work.  Or maybe you don't know
how to start your project, or publish it.  You're too busy with the
science to have time to focus on the computing.

To find out more or make a request, contact us.


Free tier: Garage, small, and medium support
--------------------------------------------

Aalto recognizes the importance of researchers in every field being
able to use scientific computing competently, so our expertise is
available to some degree to everyone.

The :ref:`SciComp garage <scicomp-garage>` is a daily online office
hour where anyone can ask us anything.  This is a great way to
un-stick any small things that you may have.  When something takes
more time than this, we can work on it for a few hours or days outside
the garage.

When we have time, and :doc:`prioritized by the participating units
<procedures/units-info>`, we can take projects for free for up to a
month.  To do this, just join the garage to get started.


With funding: long projects
---------------------------

If a project provides funding, we can work longer than a month.  We
would essentially join the project as a collaborator, as much as you
would like, and can take much more independent responsibility for
whatever you need us to do.

To get started this way, it's still best to join the garage and
request help.



How to contact us and request help
----------------------------------

To request a service, see :ref:`the request area <request-rse>`.

Requests are :doc:`prioritized <procedures/prioritization>` according to:

* Short-term "urgent help" for as many projects as possible
* Priority for projects and units which provide funding
* Strategic benefit
* Long-term impact to research (for example, improved skills)
* Diversity and balance



Examples
--------

.. note:: Master's and Bachelor's students

  The RSE service is intended for researchers, but students can be
  researchers if they are involved in a research project. To get
  started on anything longer than a short consultation, we would need
  to meet with your supervisor.  (We can arrange help of courses if
  the course instructors contact us).

Case studies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Case study: preparation for publication

   A group is about to publish a paper about a method, but their code
   is a bit messy. Without easy-to-use, (relatively) high-quality
   code, they know their impact will be minimal.  They invest in a few
   days of RSE work in order to help adopt best practices and release
   their method as open source.

.. admonition:: Case study: external grant

   A PI has gotten a large external grant, and as part of that they
   need some software development expertise.  The time frame is four
   months, but they can't hire a top-quality person on an academic
   salary for that short time.  They contact the Aalto RSE group
   (either before the grant, or while it is running) and use our
   speciality for four days per week.

.. admonition:: Case study: improve workflow

   A group of researchers all works on similar things, but independently since their
   backgrounds have been in science, not software development.  They
   invite the RSE for a quick consultation to help them get set up
   with version control and show a more modular way to structure their
   code, so they can start some real collaborations, not just talking.  This
   is the first step to more impact (and open science) from their
   work.

.. admonition:: Case study: sustainability of finished projects

   A project has ended and the main person who managed the code/analysis
   pipeline has left to continue their career somewhere else. You wish to
   replicate and extend the previous work, but your only starting point is
   a folder with hundreds of files and no clear instructions/documentation.
   Aalto RSEs can help you re-using and recycling previous code,
   document it, and extend it to make it more sustainable to be reused in
   future projects.

.. admonition:: Case study: outreach and impact

   ChatGPT wasn't in the news just because it was good - it's because
   it had an excellent interface for the public to test it.
   Developing and running these services requires a different set of
   skills than research, and Aalto RSEs can help to make and deploy
   these services.


Short-term examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Format could be personal work, lecture, or group seminar followed by a
hands-on session, for example.

* Setting up a project in version control with all the features.  This
  also includes version control of data.
* Preparing code or data for release and publication
* FAIR data (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) -
  consultation and help.
* Creating or automating a workflow, especially those processing data
  or running simulations
* Optimizing some code - both for speed and/or adaptability
* Efficiency storing data for intensive analysis.  Data replication
  and management.
* Making existing software more modular and reusable
* Help properly using, for example, machine learning library
  pipelines, instead of hacking things together yourself
* Setting up automatic software testing
* Transforming projects from individual to collaborative - either
  within a group, or open source.
* Generalized "code clean-up" which takes a project from development
  to stabilized

More involved examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These would combine co-working, mentoring, and independent work.  We
go to you and work with you.

* Developing or maintaining specific software, services, demos, or
  implementations.
* Software development as a service
* Software support that lasts beyond the time frame of a single
  student's attention
* Adding features to existing software
* Contributing to some other open source software you need for your
  research
