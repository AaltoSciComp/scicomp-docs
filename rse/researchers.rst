For researchers and research groups
===================================

You program or analyze data in your daily work, and you know something is missing:
your code and data is less organized, less efficient, less managed than others,
and it's affecting the quality of your work.  Or maybe you don't know
how to start your project, or publish it.  You're too busy with the
science to have time to focus on the computing.

To request a service, contact Aalto Scientific Computing or `answer
our survey and request to be contacted
<https://forms.gle/wxnCpCGxdUfGGqfw6>`__ this form.

.. admonition:: Case study: preparation for publication

   A group is about to publish a paper about a method, but their code
   is a bit messy. Without easy-to-use, (relatively) high-quality
   code, they know their impact will be minimal.  They invest in a few
   days of RSE work in order to help adopt best practices and release
   their method as open source.

.. admonition:: Case study: external grant

   A PI has gotten a large external grant, and as part of that they
   need some software development expertise.  The time frame is four
   months, but they can't hire a top-quality person on an academic
   salary for that short time.  They contact the Aalto RSE group
   (either before the grant, or while it is running) and use our
   speciality for four days per week.

.. admonition:: Case study: improve workflow

   A group of researchers all works on similar things, but independently since their
   backgrounds have been in science, not software development.  They
   invite the RSE for a quick consultation to help them get set up
   with version control and show a more modular way to structure their
   code, so they can start some real collaborations, not just talking.  This
   is the first step to more impact (and open science) from their
   work.

.. admonition:: Case study: sustainability of finished projects

   A project has ended and the main person who managed the code/analysis
   pipeline has left to continue their career somewhere else. You wish to
   replicate and extend the previous work, but your only starting point is
   a folder with hundreds of files and no clear instructions/documentation.
   Aalto RSEs can help you re-using and recycling previous code,
   document it, and extend it to make it more sustainable to be reused in
   future projects.

.. admonition:: Case study: outreach and impact

   ChatGPT wasn't in the news just because it was good - it's because
   it had an excellent interface for the public to test it.
   Developing and running these services requires a different set of
   skills than research, and Aalto RSEs can help to make and deploy
   these services.


What we do
----------

Our RSEs may provide both mentorship and programming-as-a-service for
your projects.  Are you tired of research being held back by slow
programming?  We can help.

**You can request our help for a few hours, to consult and co-work on
a project.** Our goal will be to primarily teaching and mentoring, to
help you help yourselves in the long run.  We'll point you in the
right direction and where to look next.

**You can also request longer-term programming as a service.**  This
can be producing or modifying some software for you, or whatever you
may need.  This is expected to be paid from your grants.  (Need someone
for a few months for your grant?  We can do that.)

.. note:: Master's and Bachelor's students

  The RSE service is intended for researchers, but students can be researchers
  if they are involved in a research project. To get started on anythin longer
  than a short consultation, we would need to meet with your supervisor.

Short-term examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Format could be personal work, lecture, or group seminar followed by a
hands-on session, for example.

* Setting up a project in version control with all the features.  This
  also includes version control of data.
* Preparing code or data for release and publication
* FAIR data (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) -
  consultation and help.
* Creating or automating a workflow, especially those processing data
  or running simulations
* Optimizing some code - both for speed and/or adaptability
* Efficiency storing data for intensive analysis.  Data replication
  and management.
* Making existing software more modular and reusable
* Help properly using, for example, machine learning library
  pipelines, instead of hacking things together yourself
* Setting up automatic software testing
* Transforming projects from individual to collaborative - either
  within a group, or open source.
* Generalized "code clean-up" which takes a project from development
  to stabilized

More involved examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These would combine co-working, mentoring, and independent work.  We
go to you and work with you.

* Developing or maintaining specific software, services, demos, or
  implementations.
* Software development as a service
* Software support that lasts beyond the time frame of a single
  student's attention
* Adding features to existing software
* Contributing to some other open source software you need for your
  research



Paid project service
--------------------

In the dedicated service, your research groups pays and we will do
whatever you want (in particular the more involved examples above).
Still, our model is as much co-working as consulting: we want to
improve your own skills so that you can still be productive
afterwards.

The research group must pay for this service, but the rate is
essentially at-cost and with minimal bureaucratic overhead.



Free basic service
------------------

In order to help *everyone* and avoid microtransactions,
departments/schools/etc can sponsor a basic service, which provides a
few hours or days of close support to improve how you work (especially
for the "basic examples" above.

One of our trained RSEs will work with you for a short period to begin
or improve your project.  The goal is not to do it for you, but to
show you by example so that you can do it yourself later.



How to contact us and request help
----------------------------------

To request a service, see :ref:`the request area <request-rse>`.

Requests are :doc:`prioritized <procedures/prioritization>` according to:

* Strategic benefit
* Long-term impact to research (for example, improved skills)
* Priority for units which provide funding
* Diversity and balance
