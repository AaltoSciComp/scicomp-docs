RSE initial training
====================

This page collects different onboarding and training materials for
Research Software Engineers in our team.  It also has a relatively
unsorted list of what could be covered in local onboardings.  It is
not right now a formal training course, but a collection of materials
for a mentor to pick and choose from use when onboarding someone.  Onboarding could be
divided into:

* **Specialized**: This isn't really covered here.  People have their
  specialties when joining and can further specialize as they advance
  in their careers (mentoring, other courses, self-study).
* **Basic tools and knowledge** (like dev tools, data management,
  etc): People know some when joining, but in the process of helping a
  variety of different projects, usually that knowledge needs to be
  expanded.
* **How to be a good supporter**: Our job isn't to do technical tasks,
  but to support research.  That means we have to support researchers,
  human-to-human.
* **Local knowledge**: everything about how stuff works locally
  (hardware/people/organizations).

Technical stuff
---------------

This list is made for new people, who have been hired as RSEs at Aalto.  This isn't a list of what someone has to know to apply, **and not what people should know before starting**.  It only provides a map, a RSE will incrementally learn things here (and probably things not on the list - this list is what we already know).  In the future, we expect this list to be copied and reused in other contexts.

Someone might take ~6 months to slowly learn things on this list as they need them.  Not everything will be needed.
