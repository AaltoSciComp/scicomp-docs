Job descriptions
================

.. warning::

   This page is still in draft form and being discussed and
   developed.  See the note on the parent page.


These are job descriptions for RSE descriptions.  They are **not** yet
formal HR job descriptions and won't be directly used as such, but
provide a vision of our career ladder.

A RSE is researcher whose advancement of science is not defined by
number of papers, but by quality of software and contributions to open
science.



RSE 1
-----

A RSE1 is just starting their career and is being introduced both to
software tools and the research process.  This RSE would get mentoring
much like a new doctoral student does, but instead of aiming to
publications, they would aim to quality, released software.

Qualifications: Masters degree, thesis in combining computation and
research or software development with some research qualifications,
but little real-world research experience.

Pay/job level:  roughly like master's employee or PhD student.
Advancement: would be expected within 1-2 years.



RSE 2
-----

Able to competently work on own projects using tools they know while
learning new tools effortlessly.  They are currently learning to
finding the right tool for the job and to connect the technical task
(software and data related) to the impact to society, Aalto, and
individual grants.

This is roughly equivalent to a postdoctoral researcher, a transition
time between academic skills of a doctorate and whatever may come
next.  In particular, this can serve as a bridge between a (somewhat
more theoretically focused) doctorate degree and a job in industry,
and CV and skills development is in line with this.

Qualifications: Doctorate or extended work experience.  Pay/job level:
similar to postdoc.

Advancement: expected to advance within 2-3 years.  This person is
still in training (much like a postdoc) and is probably deciding which
way to take their career.



RSE 3
-----

Like above, but is additionally able to independently negotiate with
research groups to plan a project, including deciding tools and
expected results.  In particular, a RSE 3 should be able to explain
the value of good software practices to the researchers and
plan/advocate for good **open science and research data management
practices** across various fields.

Pay/job level: like staff scientist, always permanent.

Advancement: A person is a competent, independent scientist/engineer
at this point, and advancing is not needed for everyone.  Of course,
lifelong learning always continues.  To be honest, advancing in the
academic system is difficult, and many people will make a horizontal
move to another place.



Internal specializations
------------------------

For reference, these are various roles which people within the team
take on.  Every person is some mix of these and no one should be
typecast, but writing them down allows us to talk about them.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * *
     * Responsibilities
   * * Project work
     * The default RSE job: given a project, learn the necessary
       scientific and technical background and work on it over time in
       close collaboration with the customers. Primary challenges
       include ongoing communication with the customers.
   * * Garage support
     * Help users with drop-in questions in garage.  Questions may be
       anything, and customers may be helped directly, you may call
       someone who can help, or they can be directed to other help
       (with advice).  Primary challenges include the huge variety of
       questions which may come, and the need to think on your feet.
   * * Project planner
     * Meet with customers to create the initial project plan,
       considering the customer's actual needs and what technology can
       solve it most efficiently.  Mentors junior RSEs in our project
       process.  Primary challenges include understanding the optimal
       solution when even the customer may not know what they need.
   * * Technical mentor
     * Work with junior RSEs in the execution of projects, giving
       pointers and co-working to teach the junior RSE new skills.
       Mentors junior RSEs in our project process.  Primary challenges
       include the hands-on teaching and knowing the tech.
   * * Unit liaison
     * Keep active communication with the unit, including telling them
       about general RSE activities, attending unit meetings, and
       keeping an active search for projects.
   * * Team Supervisor
     * Manage HR and financial practicalities, especially including
       ultimate responsibility for mentoring and productivity of all
       team members and the team itself.




Other internal/parallel advancement
-----------------------------------

Other career development is not a part of the Aalto RSE program
(yet?), and to be honest it's hard to see an internal advancement in
the current academic system (by the time you get to the top of our
team, you are already at the top).  Still, there are many ways people can
continue their career development depending on their career goals, for
example:

* Tech lead of larger RSE projects (few projects require this)
* Study and develop new technologies for production (perhaps a
  parallel move to an IT team)
* Management, either of RSE group or other services
* Applying for grants, leading projects, etc. as a staff scientist
  might do (this would be outside the RSE service team)
* Mentoring or supervising students or other researchers

At Aalto, these aspects are not yet developed, and some of them would
be horizontal moves outside the RSE team (or collaboration with
someone outside the team).  At some point, people have to take their
careers in the direction they want and begin combining various unique
skills.



Commercial developers
---------------------

We don't plan on competing with commercial developers, but the
difference with a RSE3 is that:

* A software developer can do what is asked, but not work with the
  researcher to figure out what they actually need.  The software
  developer will probably be slightly more requirements-product based,
  rather than agile-research work to develop a tool over time.

* A software developer make produce a product that is not sustainable
  in an academic setting: requires too much focus and specialized
  knowledge to be improved in an academic environment.

* A software developer may use more modern and industrial-scale tools.

* A software developer from outside would come in and leave, a RSE in
  this group would provide longer-term support (but this is more a
  property of the group, not the person).
