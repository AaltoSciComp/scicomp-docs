Prioritization and reporting
============================

This page describes the types of projects we have, the general
principles of how we prioritize them, and how we can show where our
time goes.

Types of projects and other terminology
---------------------------------------

* Size **Garage (G)**: the smallest support, handled within the
  :doc:`daily garage </help/garage>`.  A few hours and not scheduled,
  they are handled as people come to garage.  Entered in the garage
  diary, but not the rse-projects tracker.
* Size **Small (S)**: <= 1-2 days.
* Size **Medium (M)**: <= 1 month.
* Size **Large (L)**: > 1 month.  These are generally paid by the
  projects themselves.
* **Dedicated funding** is when a project or unit pays 100% of the
  salary of a RSE.  They get priority for all of that RSEs work, but
  they are still supported as a team and we always try to take the
  best person for each job.
* **Retainer funding** is when a research group sets up funding to be
  used for various projects within their group.  These projects take
  priority, but since we don't charge for waiting, we can't reserve time.

RSE staff that are fully funded from a certain project out outside the
system of this page, and work on the projects as decided by their
funders.


Prioritization between units
----------------------------

See :doc:`units-info`.  In general, we want to make sure that we do
medium and long projects in proportion to the incoming funding from
various units.  This is handled at the weekly RSE meeting, where we
look at projects and decide what should be taken on.  The RSE team
leader will guide these decisions.

Each garage session (and equivalently, meeting of projects too small
to have a rse-projects issue) should be tracked in the garage diary
with the unit, and this goes into a yearly report.  Each medium/large
project is recorded in the rse-projects issue tracker with its size,
and this goes into the yearly report.



Prioritization between sizes
----------------------------

Garage projects usually get priority, because they are quick,
impactful help and serve as a way for our team to share skills
internally.  Whoever is available will help (it can often be the same
person over several days).  We help these regardless of the Aalto unit
of the customer, but if we notice big imbalances forming, we'll start
to do something about it.  Customers can continue returning to the
garage, but they need to keep track of the work.

Small jobs are garage projects which have slightly grown so that
we work on them outside garage, but the customer is still in charge of
making sure things move forward.  We do these when we have time, as
decided by each RSE themselves during garage.

Medium projects are big enough they must be planned and scheduled,
making sure to balance between units.  These are funded with basic
funding, so the :doc:`unit basic funding <units-info>` guides us.
Often garage or a planning meeting is used to make the plan, then it's
approved and scheduled during a weekly RSE meeting, then we'll get
back to the customer.

Large projects, being paid by a particular group, usually get priority.
However, often time there is downtime during these, which are used for
other projects.

Some research groups provide **"retainer" funding**: long-term funding
without a specific L-size project.  Their funding is used for whatever
S and M projects come up, and those S and M projects get a much higher
priority and the same person helping each time (of course, depending
on the urgency of the project itself).

There are two main steps in our prioritization:

* General discussions during the weekly team meetings.
* Each RSE's evaluation of each project, based on their knowledge of
  the work, the time they have, and what the benefit will be.

Per-project prioritization factors:

* Self-evaluation of usefulness and importance by the researchers.
* Benefit to open science and broader strategic impact.
* Long-term impact to research (for example, improved skills or use of
  existing infrastructures and tools).
* Priority for units which provide funding and their strategy.
* Diversity and balance, including diversity goals.
