Unit information
================

This page describes the Aalto units which are supporting the RSE
program and what their priorities are.  Our basic priorities:

* First, we try to do all **garage/short projects** (day or less).  These
  have a high impact because they unblock immediate problems.
  Reporting is via the end-of-year garage report.

* Then, we try to do all **long projects** (month+), balanced and
  prioritized according to the list below.  (As of 2025, if you aren't
  on the list below, we usually still find time.)

* Then, we work on **medium projects** (days--weeks), which are free
  for the customers, balanced and prioritized according to the list
  below.  (There are always some medium projects, because they serve
  as a necessary buffer.)

* Anyone we don't have time for at the higher levels, we would help
  them in a simpler way (for example, giving advice as a garage/short
  project instead of doing it for them as a medium project).

See :doc:`../units` if you would like to join the RSE service as a
department or school.

(*) Share is a general fraction.  Funding may be lower than this
fraction, since long projects replace the funding of the unit.
