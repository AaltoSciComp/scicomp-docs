For grant applicants
====================

.. warning::

   Grant applicants, if you are planning to use Aalto Research
   Software Engineers service, feel free to drop by :ref:`SciComp
   garage for a chat <garage>`, contact us at rse at aalto.fi,
   or fill out our `request form
   <https://selfservice.esupport.aalto.fi/ssc/app#/order/2026/>`__.

   This page is currently (2024-01) our best understanding of what is
   possible.  However, we are still exploring what works and doesn't,
   so contact us early so we can work out bugs together.  Please send
   corrections to us.


If you've decided you would like to use the :doc:`research software
engineer <index>` services in your project for a long period, you
might want to write it directly into your grant proposals.  If written
correctly, this can increase your competitiveness:
your research will be better because you can use RSEs for
porting/optimizing/scaling of codes, automation, data management, and
open science, while concentrating the main
project resources on the actual research question.  We can do those
listed things *much* faster than most researchers.

If you don't know if you need our services, or need a consultation of
what is even possible computationally, let us know, too!

.. admonition:: Summary

   * We can serve as a specialist to complement the researchers in
     your project, which will make your grant more competitive.
   * Plan on "Staff Scientist" salary level for at least a few months
     when convenient for you.  (can be as low as 10% time spread out
     over a longer period of time).
   * We are written is as a normal staff, since we are.  **Don't
     mention subcontracting or purchasing** or things that imply that
     (this can make funders ask questions).
   * Just like with academic staff, until you have funding, there is
     no guarantee that our exact people (or someone) will be
     available.  You should write us in to improve your grant.  Worst
     case, we advise you in hiring someone to do what you need and
     help mentor them.
   * :doc:`Contact us <request>` for more exact costs and our
     availability.



Funding options
---------------

Short-term services, less than one month per research group, are
funded by various departments and schools and free to the users (part
of the "research environment" services).  Longer term service should
be funded by projects - either an external grant or basic funds.
There are two ways to write this into a project proposal:

1. As a **research salary**, just like other salaries on your project.
   This has fewer limits, but is less flexible because we need to go
   through HR and financial planning.

2. As a **internal changing/purchased service**, like usage of
   different infrastructures.  This is flexible, but not compatible
   with some funders.  It should work well with internal, basic
   funding.

**Don't mention subcontracting or purchasing in your grant text**
unless it really has to be organized that way.  Make us appear as
normal employees, since we are.



(1) Funding RSE salary
-----------------------

In this option, your grant directly pays the salary of an RSE from our
team.  To a funder, this appears the same as hiring a researcher, so
is compatible with many types of grants.  Some considerations:

* This only works internally in Aalto.
* Contact us for salary levels (it is roughly staff scientist) and
  availability.
* Tell your controller this salary level and duration.  Your
  controller will compute the necessary overhead and tell you if it is
  possible.  (You should tell you financial staff/HR/etc. that the
  salary will be used for someone in the School of Science
  (SCI-common) and ensure that this is fine.)
* Finance/HR will set up the Halli system so that we can bill our
  working hours directly to your project, based on actual time we work.
* Realistically, we can spend up to about 80-90% time in a month on a
  single project (but you must make sure we have time first!).
* We bill only the actual time relevant to your project, so
  while the costs are higher, in the end we are much more efficient
  than typical researchers who have many other tasks going on.



(2) Purchasing RSE services
---------------------------

Contact us with your needs, and we can give you an estimated price and
time required.  We can provide the services distributed over a time
period that is relevant to you.

* **Warning**: many funders (for example, the Academy of Finland or
  EU) don't like for this to be used in their grants.  If you do
  include this in a grant, carefully consult with grant/financial
  services to make sure this is possible.
* In theory, we can serve groups outside of Aalto, but overheads are
  quite large.  We are working on a RSE network within Finland so that
  we you can efficiently get RSE services no matter where you are.



General grant considerations
----------------------------

You can find general boilerplate text to include in your proposals
:doc:`/about/for-proposals`, but you can read below to build it in
even more.

Data Management / Open Science are big deals among some funders right
now, and research engineers are perfect for helping with these things
because they are experts in the associated technical challenges.  The
RSE service can help in the societal impact sections: your outputs
will be more ready to be reused by society.  You could, for example,
promise to deliver more types of outputs that aren't exactly novel
science but help society to use your results (e.g. databases,
interactive visualisations, etc.).

Make sure you mention the general Science-IT infrastructure in the
"research environment" section, i.e., the basic service provided by
Aalto.  You can copy something from the boilerplate text (first link
in this section).



Specific funders
----------------

Academy of Finland
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This applies to most general research grants, from the `general terms
and conditions
<https://www.aka.fi/en/research-funding/apply-for-funding/how-to-use-funding/>`__.
Funding may be used to cover costs related to the research plan or
action plan.  The research site must fund basic project facilities -
which is the case at Aalto for basic RSE services.

Interesting terms from the Academy: it urges research data and methods
to be freely available.  6.2.2: "Research data and material produced
with Academy funding in research projects and research infrastructure
projects must be made freely available as soon as possible after the
research results have been published."  We are experts in exactly
this for computational and data sciences.

* As a RSE salary:

  * Contact us for the salary level which you should budget and our
    availability.  Your controller will help you write this into the
    budget.

  * "Salaries, fees and indirect employee costs" may be included in
    Academy projects.  These may go to research software engineers,
    which to the academy appear equivalent to "normal researchers".
    The RSEs *are* researchers.

  * Write in a Research Software Engineer as a salary for a set number
    of months.  You may specify a name as N.N., or contact us for a
    name to include.  We do *not* promise any one person,
    but we will work with you as much as possible.  Contact us for
    costs per person and we will put you in touch with our
    controllers.  You can also :doc:`contact us <request>` to
    discuss how much effort you may need.

  * Note that "We recommend that they be hired for a period of
    employment no shorter than the funding period, unless a shorter
    contract is necessary for special reasons dictated by the
    implementation of the research plan or action plan (or
    equivalent). Short-term research, studies or other assignments
    may also be carried out in the form of outsourced services."  So,
    consider this in justifying the research plan.

  * Don't call this subcontracting or purchasing.  It's normal
    internal salary.

* As a service purchase:

  * .. warning::

      Our latest information indicates that internal billing (this
      service purchase) is not really possible for Academy grants.
      You must use "As a RSE salary" above.

  * Please contact us for general costs, and how many person-months
    you can get for a given price (it is roughly on "Staff Scientist"
    level).  Since estimating the amount of effort
    needed is difficult, :doc:`contact us <request>` and we can
    help you prepare with the help of our controllers.

  * The research site should provide "basic project facilities", which
    Aalto does.  Justify the extra purchase as beyond the basics.

  * Maximum amount: We recommend you include no more than XXXXX as a
    service purchase.  Please see LINK (login required) for our
    prices, when paid via external funding.

  * Justification for funding (include in proposal): "Technical
    specialist work to ensure scientific and societal impact outputs
    follow best practices in software development and research data
    management practices, so that they can be of greatest possible
    benefit to society."

  * Flexibility: we could flexibly invoice as needed for your
    project.  You don't have to decide the time period in
    advance (only follow your submitted budget), and different RSEs
    can work on different parts of the problem, so you always have the
    best person for the job.



European Commission grants
--------------------------

Internal billing is (for practical purposes) not possible
for EC grants.  Use the "RSE salary" method (and don't call it
subcontracting or purchasing - we are normal salary).

With EU projects, since the funding is generally less flexible, you
should consider how the funding can be flexibly used if we don't have
enough staff at the specific times you plan.  For example,
interchanging with other staff categories.  (As of 2025, until there
is funding, we can't reserve future time).  However, as said above, in
the worst case we will help you get started and help you find an
appropriate person to hire (and mentor them along the way).  So far,
we've been able to help almost all projects to their satisfaction.
