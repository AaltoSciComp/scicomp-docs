For units such as departments
=============================

Our service is funded by departments and schools, and members of these
units can receive our services free of charge for a short period of
time (in accordance to the shares of funding). In addition to the
basic service, researchers and group leaders can request long-term
support which they pay for themselves.

**By joining the Research Software Engineering service, you provide
the highest-quality computational tools to your researchers, enabling
the best possible research and attracting the best possible
candidates.  You fund a certain amount of time, and actual cost
decreases when groups pay for long-term service themselves.  For both
short and long-term projects, our surveys indicate a significant
efficiency: (researcher time saved) ≥ 5 × (time we spend).**

.. admonition:: Case study: Systematic improvements

   Your department has a lot of people doing little bits of
   programming everywhere, but everyone is doing things alone. What
   if they could work together better? By joining the RSE program as
   a unit, your staff can get up to X hours of free help to understand
   tools to make their programming/data work better. After a few
   years, you notice a dramatic cultural shift: there is more
   collaboration and higher-quality work. Perhaps you already see a
   change in your KPIs.



Benefits
--------

Benefits to schools/departments:

* Increase the quality and efficiency of your research by providing
  the best possible tools and support.
* Provide hands-on technical research services to your community at a
  higher level than basic IT (see :doc:`/help/garage`).
* More societal impact, for example ChatGPT-type preview interfaces.
* Help with data management, open science, FAIR data - be more
  competitive for funding and help get value out of your unit's data.
* You will be able to set priorities for your funding, for example do
  you focus on a certain strategy, wide variety of projects,
  high-impact project, etc.

Benefits to groups:

* Receive staff/on-call software development expertise within your
  group, without having to make a separate hire.  We don't disappear
  right after your project.
* Your researchers focus on their science while improving their
  computational skills by co-working with us.



How to join
-----------

The RSE program is a part of Aalto Science-IT (Aalto Scientific
Computing), so is integrated to our computing and data management
infrastructure and training programs.  You don't just get a service,
but a whole community of experts.  We can seamlessly work with
existing technical services within your department for even more
knowledge transfer - if it matches their mission, your existing
technical services can even join us directly.

In practice, joining us means that you contribute a certain amount of
funding, which allows us to hire more staff (combined with the other
departments), to provide a certain amount of time to research groups
in your unit.

If you would like to join contact Richard Darst or rse-group at
aalto.fi.
