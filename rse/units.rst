For units who would like Research Software Engineers
====================================================

Computing is everywhere, even in your unit.  But computing is hard, so
much that can go wrong: bugs take time to fix, data gets messy and
can't be used, code can't be used by others.  **Everyone needs
computing and data, but not everyone can or should be a computer
scientist.**

There is a better way.  Scientific computing must be a team effort in
the future (just like physical laboratories have their own
specialists).



What are Research Software Engineers (RSE)?
-------------------------------------------

In Aalto RSE's vision, they are the co-researcher you need for your
projects. **We are part of technical services, and we focus on all
your computational challenges**, streamlining your research.

* **Research:** with research background, supporting research (not IT
  specialists).
* **Software:** programming, workflows, data (not only "software")
* **Engineer:** structural integrity, quality (not focused on
  publications) - the engineer compared to your architects.

RSEs are not normal ITs staff or "HPC specialists" - these support IT
or HPC infrastructure.  RSE support *research* across all of these
tools.  Check :doc:`the sample portfolio <portfolio>`.

Aalto Research Software Engineers are part of Science-IT, a U-level
infrastructure and virtual team.

This exists in SCI since 2020 and can exist for you, too.

       One way of looking at the types of projects a RSE can do.  Note we
       do anything from providing advice to speed up other projects to
       doing projects ourselves, where an academic can't.

         We work on anything from basic problems to advanced research
         collaboration.



Real benefits
-------------

During the work we have seen many real benefits.

**Statistics show that when the RSE spends X time, the academic's
time saved is 5X.**

* Solve daily computing/data problems
* Take on long-term development out of scope for academic staff
* Code is more reusable - take long term value
* Research is faster
* Keeping data organized
* Port code and manage workflows on supercomputers (use existing infra
  better)
* Finalizing projects and making nice interfaces for societal impact.
* Manage automation and workflows: reach a larger scale.
* Assist in planning for research ethics evaluations and data
  management.



Proposal: join us and we expand Science-IT
------------------------------------------

It's time to consider the benefits wider at Aalto.  **Science-IT is a
virtual team and your unit can easily join.**

**Current state:** ITS provides funding for SCI-RSE to do small
projects outside of SCI.  We are reaching the limit of our stability,
and other units need specialists in their research.

* You can hire an approprate RSE within your unit.

* They work as part of the Science-IT virtual team.

* SCI-RSE helps with start-up:

  * SCI-RSE can help hiring and onboarding
  * SCI-RSE can mentor in software/data/SciComp skills
  * SCI-RSE can help connect to the right kind of projects
  * We work as a team

* In 2025-2026, we have the possibility of development project
  co-funding for a 2-3 year startup.


.. admonition:: School of Science practices
   :class: dropdown

   At the School of Science our arrangement is:

   - Have hired at the school level as Technical Services
   - Full time and permanent
   - Job title "Research Engineer", business title "Research Software
     Engineer".
   - Service staff with regular working hours.
   - Funded from school and department budgets.  Research projects
     also directly contribute funding via Halli for their share of the
     work, reducing the school share.
   - Some flagships projects fund some RSE staff 100% and they are
     dedicated for that project.



Details
-------

You'd decide how to best manage hiring: internal reallocation or new
hires.  With negotiation, SCI *might* be able to do the hires for
other units.

  explains how we can start off with the schools working together.

* `What is a RSE - ASC blog

  into detail about how a RSE fits in with existing academic staff.



How to get in touch
