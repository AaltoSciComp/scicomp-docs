Research Software Engineers
===========================

The Aalto `Research Software Engineers <rse-history_>`_ (RSEs) provide
specialist support regarding
software, computing, and data. As research becomes more digital and
computer-dependent, the prerequisite knowledge grows larger and
larger, and we exist to help you fill that gap.

For anything related to **custom software development, computational
research, data management, workflow automation, scaling-up, deployment
of public previews,
collaborative work, reproducible research, optimization,
high-performance computing, and more**, we can:

* **Do it for you:** You need some custom technical
  software/solution.  We do it for you, you get straight to your work.
* **Do it with you:** We co-work with your group, teaching while we go
  along.
* **Make it reusable:** You already have something, but it doesn't
  work for others.
* **Plan your ambitions:** Figure out how far you can reach in your
  next project or grant.

Instead of hiring your own intern, postdoc, etc. to struggle with
certain issues, we can help instead.  We consist of experienced
researchers who have relied heavily on computing technology
(programming, computing, data) for our academic work, and thus can
seamlessly collaborate on research projects.  We can also do
consultation and training.  You will have more
impact since your work is more reusable, open, and higher quality.  We
can work on existing projects or you can write us directly into your
grant applications.

**Service availability:** Garage support is available to everyone.
Longer project work is also available to everyone at Aalto thanks to
grants from Aalto IT Services.  For more information, see
:doc:`procedures/units-info`.

This is the hands-on compliment our training programs, mainly
:doc:`scientific computing in practice sessions </training/scip/index>` and
`CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`_.  If you want a kickstart
to put those sessons in practice, this is for you.  Attendance
in these courses is useful but by no means required.
