For RSE candidates and community
================================

This page is designed to guide people into the interesting world of
research software engineering: providing a view into the types of
skills that are useful to research groups at Aalto.  It also provides
links to training material which our RSEs should learn after
starting (so don't be intimidated by what you see on here!).

Do you like coding and research, but don't want an academic career
path with publications as your sole purpose?  Be a Research Software
Engineer with us!  Our pilot is designed to bridge the gap between
academic research and a future career in research software or a
research scientist in a company.

If (some of) the following apply to you, you are a good candidate:

* I like the academic environment, but don't want to focus just on
  making publications.
* I am reasonably good at some programming concepts, and am eager to
  learn more.  I know one language well, can shell script, and
  generally familiar with Linux.
* I am interested in going to a scientist-developer kind of role in a
  company, but need more experience before I can make the transition.



General qualifications and duties
---------------------------------

We strongly prefer good computational researchers (PhD level
preferred) who can improve their software development skills than the
other way around.  This role can be combined with other roles, but
note that this is not targeted to those who intend to follow a
tenure-track academic career path.  New RSEs will get a training
period which rounds out any missing skills.  They will also be
involved in a complete support package: they will have the chance to
be involved in teaching an infrastructure development.



Job advertisements
------------------

From time to time, job advertisements are posted on the `Aalto
University job portal <https://www.aalto.fi/en/open-positions>`__,
with notices on various other channels including Aalto scientific
computing mailing lists.


Skillset
--------

Below, we have a large list of the types of technologies which are valued
by our researchers and useful to our RSEs.  **No one person is expected to
know everything, but we
will hire a variety of people to cover many of the things you see
here.**

Most important is *do you want to learn things from this list?  Can
you do so mostly independently but with the help of a great team?*



General tech skills
-------------------
Our broad background on which we build:

* Basic mandatory skills include Linux, shell scripting, some
  low-level programming language (C, Fortran), and programming in
  several more languages (Python particularly advantageous).
* Good knowledge of computer clusters, batch systems, and
  high-performance computing.
* Any additional programming, workflow, research, or system tools are
  a plus.  You should have a wide range of skills, but the exact
  skills are not so important.  Most important is sufficient fluency
  to pick up anything quickly.  These skills should be listed as an
  appendix to the cover letter if not included in the CV.
* Advanced parallel programming skills are a plus, but equally
  important is the ability to create good, simple, practical tools.
* Git, GitHub, git-based collaborative workflows.
* Software testing, CI, documentation, reproducible, portability, etc.
* As an example, the ideal candidate will have near-perfect knowledge
  of all `Software Carpentry <swc_>`_, `CodeRefinery <cr_>`_, and the generic parts of
  our :ref:`HPC lessons <tutorials>` - or be able to fill in gaps with
  minimal effort.
* But at the same time, we don't just want people from purely
  computational backgrounds.  You'll work with people from
  experimental sciences, digital humanities, etc, and good people from
  these backgrounds are important, too.
* A good attitude towards mentoring and teaching and an ability to
  explain complex subjects in an accessible way.
* Commitment to diversity and equality of researchers among many
  different backgrounds.
* Good knowledge of English.  Finnish is advantageous but not required,
  our internal working language is English.

Teaching and mentoring skills
-----------------------------
You won't be just preforming technical tasks.  As part of being a RSE,
you need to help others to be self-sufficient as well.  This requires
teaching and mentoring skills.

* `How to help someone use a computer by Phil Agre
  <https://www.librarian.net/stax/4965/how-to-help-someone-use-a-computer-by-phil-agre/>`__
* `Motivation and demotivation
  <https://teachtogether.tech/#s:motivation>`__, a chapter in Teaching
  Tech Together.
* `History of the RSE concept <https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0>`__



Specific examples
-----------------
This is a selection of advanced skills which are useful (remember,
this is what you might learn, not what you already know):

* Advanced experience of debugging/profiling/developing Linux tools,
  including Git, Intel and GNU compiler suits and corresponding tools.
* Software building tools like Make, CMake and alike.
* Advanced knowledge of parallel programming models, experience of
  parallel programming (OpenMP, MPI).
* Advanced GPU computing / programming (CUDA, OpenACC, OpenMP models),
  experience of porting software to GPUs.
* Profiling and optimization - both of low-level languages and
  high-level.
* Knowledge of scientific software and packages including Matlab,
  Mathematica, Python libs, others is beneficial.
* Experimental data collection, LabView, etc.
* Workflow automation, shell scripting, porting from single machines
  to clusters.
* Docker, Singularity, containers.
* Data analysis tools like R, Python, pandas, numpy, etc. are
  beneficial.
* Julia, Matlab, Mathematica.
* Web development, cloud operations.
* Scientific Computing on other operating systems.


Open science and data
---------------------
As a RSE, you should also serve as an advocate for open science,
reproducible research, and data management.

* Data management, data engineering, data wrangling.
* Reproducible research.
* Open source software development, community formation.
* Software packaging and distribution, (e.g. PyPI, conda, etc.).


Training resources
