Current status of Aalto RSE
---------------------------

We have continued as in past years, pretty successfully.  During 2025,
we grew from 7 staff to 10 staff with a new Lumi AI Factory grant to
a research group in the CS department.

For more information on the types of projects we do, see the previous
year's report: :doc:`2024`.



Our KPIs
--------

As we have matured, our previous KPIs of "number of projects per year"
isn't appropriate anymore - our projects are becoming larger, and small stuff is being handled in garage.


RSE project stats
-----------------

A "project" is any RSE activity that takes more than a few days and
has significant RSE investment, including taking a leading role.

Note that projects span years, and each project is heuristically
assigned to some year.

   RSE project per primary unit.  SCI dominates, because so far almost
   all funding has been from within SCI.

   This shows the (relative) times spent on different types of common
   things we do.


	     
Garage support stats
--------------------

"Garage support" is our drop-in "office hour" online every day,
including any other small customer contacts and small projects which
remain the primary responsibility of the customer.  In 2025, we have
emphasized garage as the way we support and record anything smaller
than a "project".

Note: We do not have complete data: we record when we can, but often
miss people.

   active, there is a great variety.
