Python project checklist
========================

This checklist covers major considerations when creating a
high-quality, maintainable, reusable Python codebase.  It is designed
to be used along with a RSE to guide you through it (it is in a draft
stage, and doesn't have link to what these mean).  Not everything is
expected for every project, but a sufficiently advanced complicated
project will have most of these things.
