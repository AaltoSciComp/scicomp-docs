RSE project done
================


Discuss with the researchers
----------------------------

* Explicitly confirm with customers that we are ending our focus on
  this project and won't do more until we hear from them again.
* Confirm it is publicly released, licensed, everything is done (or
  discuss what else might need to be done).
* Make sure outputs are reported into ACRIS  This is important because
  it makes our work visible.

  * Software: Add Content → Research output → Artistic and non-textual
    output → Software.
  * Data: https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/research-data-and-acris
    (Add Content → Dataset)
  * For each entry, under "Facilities/Equipment", add ""Science IT"".
    This links it as an output of Aalto RSE.
  * Anyone can do this and add other relevant authors.  The metadata
    entry can be made private or public, and the actual software/data
    is usually hosted elsewhere (and can be public or not).

* Discuss what to do if there are issues in the future - garage, issue
  tracker, training courses.
* Discuss what else may (or may not) need doing in the future.


Internal (RSE group) tasks
--------------------------

* Issue tracker:

  * ``/summary`` should contain a several sentence summary focused on the
    benefit to RSE service (this is used for final reports, etc).
  * Confirm other metadata is correct

    * ``/contact``, ``/supervisor`` contains
      people who may get emails about the project later (and shouldn't
      contain people who may be surprised about automated survey
      emails).  If these people should not get
    * ``/timesaved``
    * Outputs ``/projects``, ``/publications``, ``/software``,
      ``/datasets``, ``/outputs``

* Get an interesting picture or screenshot for use in future material.

  * Not needed if there are overriding confidentiality
    considerations.  The picture should never include personal data or
    data coming from a research subject (unless it's already open).
  * Add to ``triton:/scratch/scicomp/aaltoscicomp-marketing.git``
    (``pictures/rse/``).
  * Include a readme with citation, confirmation
    of what usage permissions there are, and a one-sentence general
    description suitable for presentations.
  * Examples; screenshot of website, screenshot of code that looks
    interesting, screenshot of repository page, picture of hardware
    device used, etc.

* Add it to the next meeting agenda.  We will collaboratively do an
  analysis to find lessons learned:

  * Facts about the project
  * Arrange facts into the big picture and timeline
  * Draw conclusions: what went well and did not go well?  What were
    the causes of the good and bad things?
  * Lessons learned: what to do differently in the future.
