The scripts you need for the following exercises can be found in our
`hpc-examples <https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/hpc-examples>`__, which
we discussed in :doc:`/triton/tut/cluster-shell` (section
:ref:`triton-tut-example-repo`).
You can clone the repository by running
``git clone https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/hpc-examples.git``. Doing this
creates you a local copy of the repository in your current working
directory. This repository will be used for most of the tutorial exercises.
