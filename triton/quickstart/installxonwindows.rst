Installing and running an X-Server on Windows
=============================================

This tutorial explains how to install an X-Server on Windows. We will use the VcXsrv, a free X-server for this purpose.

Steps:
* 1. Download the Installer from `here <https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/files/latest/download>`_
* 2. Run the installer.
  * Select ``Full`` under Installation Options and click ``Next``
  * Select a target folder

To Run the Server:
* Open the ``XLaunch`` program (most likely on your desktop)
* Select ``Multiple Windows`` and click ``Next``
* Select ``Start no client`` and click ``Next``
* On the ``Extra settings`` window, click ``Next``
* On the ``Finish configuration`` page click ``Finish``


You have now started your X-Server.

Set up your console
-------------------

In the ``Git bash`` or the windows command line (``cmd``) terminal, before you connect to an ssh server, you have to set the used display.
Under normal circumstances, VcXsrv will start the Xserver as display 0.0. If for some reason the remote graphical user 
interface does not start later on, you can check, the actual display by right-clicking on the tray-icon of the X-Server
and select ``Show log``.  
Search for ``DISPLAY`` in the log file, and you will find something like:  

::

    DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0.0
   
In your terminal enter:

::

    set DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0.0
    
Now you are set up to connect to the server of your choice via:

::

    ssh -Y your.target.host

Notice, that on windows you will likely need the ``-Y`` flag for X-Server connections, since it seems ``-X`` does not normally work.
