Triton cluster
==============

Triton is the Aalto high-performance computing cluster.  It serves all
researchers
of Aalto, but is currently coordinated from within the School of
Science.  Access is free for researchers (students not doing research
should check out our :doc:`intro for students
<../aalto/welcomestudents>`).  It is similar to the CSC
clusters, though CSC clusters are larger and Triton is easier to use
because it is more integrated into the Aalto environment.

Tutorials
=========
These are designed to be read (or `watched <tutorial-playlist_>`__) in-order by every Triton user when they
get their accounts (except maybe the last ones).  In order to use
Triton well, in the `Hands-on SciComp roadmap <hosc_>`__ you should
also know the `Basics (A) <hosc-a_>`__ and `Linux (C) <hosc-c_>`__
levels as a prerequisite.
