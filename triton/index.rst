Triton cluster
==============

Triton is the Aalto high-performance computing cluster.  It serves all
researchers
of Aalto, but is currently coordinated from within the School of
Science.  Access is free for researchers (see :doc:`accounts`,
students not doing research
should check out our :doc:`intro for students
<../aalto/welcomestudents>`).  It is similar to the CSC
clusters, though CSC clusters are larger and Triton is easier to use
because it is more integrated into the Aalto environment.

Tutorials
=========

These are designed to be read (or `watched <tutorial-playlist_>`__) in-order by every Triton user when they
get their accounts (except maybe the last ones).  In order to use
Triton well, in the `Hands-on SciComp roadmap <hosc_>`__ you should
also know the `Basics (A) <hosc-a_>`__ and `Linux (C) <hosc-c_>`__
levels as a prerequisite.
