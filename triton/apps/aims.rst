.. admonition:: Warning: page not updated for current Triton
  :class: warning, triton-v2-apps

  This page hasn't been updated since Triton was completely upgraded
  in May 2024.  The software might not be installed and the old
  information below might not work anymore (or  might need adapting).
  If you need this software, :ref:`open an issue <issuetracker>` and
  tell us so we can reinstall/update it.

`FHI-aims <https://aimsclub.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/>`__Â  (Fritz Haber
Institute ab initio molecular simulations package) is an electronic
structure theory code package for computational molecular and
materials science. FHI-aims density functional theory and many-body
perturbation calculations at all-electron, full-potential level.

FHI-aims is licensed software with voluntary payment for an `academic
license
<https://aimsclub.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/aims_obtaining_simple.php>`__. While
the license grants access to the FHI-aims source code each holder of a
license can use pre-built binaries available on Triton. To this end,
contact Ville Havu at the PHYS department after obtaining the license.

On Triton the most recent version of FHI-aims is available via the
modules ``FHI-aims/latest-intel-2020.0`` that is compiled using the
Intel Parallel Studio and
``FHI-aims/latest-OpenMPI-intel-2020.0-scalapack`` that is compiled
without any Intel parallel libraries since in rare cases they can
result in spurious segfaults. The binaries are available in
``/share/apps/easybuild/software/FHI-aims/<module name>/bin`` as
``aims.YYMMDD.scalapack.mpi.x`` where ``YYMMDD`` indicates the version
stamp.

Notes:

- ``module spider fhi`` will show various versions available.
- The clean Intel version is fastest, but the OpenMPI module is more
  stable (info as of 2021-07).
- FHI-aims is compiled without any Intel parallel libraries since in rare
  cases, like really big systems, they can result in spurious
  segfaults.
- Search the Triton issue tracker for some more debugging about this.
