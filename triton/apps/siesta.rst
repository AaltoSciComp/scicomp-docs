.. admonition:: Warning: page not updated for current Triton
  :class: warning, triton-v2-apps

  This page hasn't been updated since Triton was completely upgraded
  in May 2024.  The software might not be installed and the old
  information below might not work anymore (or  might need adapting).
  If you need this software, :ref:`open an issue <issuetracker>` and
  tell us so we can reinstall/update it.

Copy-pasted Makefiles from Rocks. Should be used as a starting point. If
you have a fully working version for SL6.2, send us a copy please.
