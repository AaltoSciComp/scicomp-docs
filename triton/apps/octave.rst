  :class: warning, triton-v2-apps

  This page hasn't been updated since Triton was completely upgraded
  in May 2024.  The software might not be installed and the old
  information below might not work anymore (or  might need adapting).
  If you need this software, :ref:`open an issue <issuetracker>` and
  tell us so we can reinstall/update it.

From Octave's `web page <https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/about.html>`_:
    GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.

    Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in Octaveâ€™s own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.

Getting started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply load the latest version of Octave.

::

    module load octave
    octave

It is best to pick a version of octave and stick with it.  Do ``module
spider octave`` and use the whole name::

    module load octave/4.4.1-qt-python2

To run octave with the GUI, run it with::

    octave --force-gui

Installing packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing packages you should create a file ``~/.octaverc`` with the 
following content::

    package_dir = ['/scratch/work/',getenv('USER'),'/octave'];
    eval (["pkg prefix ",package_dir, ";"]);
    setenv("CXX","g++ -std=gnu++11")
    setenv("DL_LD","g++ -std=gnu++11")
    setenv("LD_CXX","g++ -std=gnu++11")
    setenv("CC","gcc")
    setenv("F77","gfortran")

This sets up ``/scratch/work/$USER/octave`` to be your Octave package directory
and sets ``gcc`` to be your compiler. By setting Octave package directory to
your work directory you won't run into any quota issues.

After this you should load ``gcc``\ - and ``texinfo``\ -modules. This gives you an 
up-to-date compiler and tools that Octave uses for its documentation::

    module load gcc
    module load texinfo

Now you can install packages in octave with e.g.::

    pkg install -forge -local io

After this you can unload the ``gcc``\ - and ``texinfo``\ -modules::

    module unload gcc
    module unload texinfo
