Star-CD and Star-CCM+
=====================

:supportlevel: C (best-effort)
:maintainer: Olli Ranta

StarCD and StarCCM are computational fluid dynamics software.  StarCD
is an older version and StarCCM is the newer version.


Prerequisites
-------------

These are licensed software, and limited to a certain unix group.  For
access, contact Olli Ranta (MechE technical services).


Basic usage
-----------

There is one ``starcd`` module, but most usage is direct without
access.  For information on what current installations are available,
and how to use them contact Olli (above).
To make the starccm and starview commands available run `module load starcd/2402_multinode`.
Admin notes: They are installed in
/appl/manual_installations/{starcd,starccm}/ and should be protected
by a unix group.
