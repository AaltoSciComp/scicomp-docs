This page will explain how to run Matlab jobs on triton, and introduce 
important details about Matlab on triton.
(Note: We used to have the Matlab Distributed Computing Server (MDCS),
but because of low use we no longer have a license.  You can still
run in parallel on one node, with up to 40 cores.)

Interactive usage
-----------------

Interactive usage is currently available via the ``sinteractive`` tool. Do
not use the cluster front-end for this, but connect to a node with ``sinteractive``
The login node is only meant for submitting jobs/compiling. 
To run an interactive session with a user interface run the following commands from a terminal.

::

    ssh -X user@triton.aalto.fi
    sinteractive
    module load matlab
    matlab &

Simple serial script
--------------------

Running a simple Matlab job is easy through the slurm queue. A
sample slurm script is provided below::

    #!/bin/bash -l
    #SBATCH --time=00:05:00
    #SBATCH --mem=100M
    #SBATCH -o serial_Matlab.out
    module load matlab
    n=3
    m=2
    srun matlab -nojvm -nosplash -r "serial_Matlab($n,$m) ; exit(0)"

The above script can then be saved as a file (e.g. matlab_test.slrm) and the job can be submitted with ``sbatch matlab_test.slrm``. The actual calculation is done in ``serial_Matlab.m``\ -file

.. code:: matlab

    function C = serial_Matlab(n,m)
            try
                    A=0:(n*m-1);
                    A=reshape(A,[2,3]).'

                    B=2:(n*m+1);
                    B=reshape(B,[2,3]).'

                    C=0.5*ones(n,n)
                    C=A*(B.') + 2.0*C
            catch error
                    disp(getReport(error))
                    exit(1)
            end
    end

Remember to *always* set exit into your slurm script so that the program quits
once the function ``serial_Matlab`` has finished. Using a
try-catch-statement will allow your job to finish in case of any error
within the program.  If you don't do this, Matlab will drop into
interactive mode and do nothing while your job wastes time. 

NOTE: Starting from version r2019a the launch options  ``-r ...; exit(0)`` can be easily 
replaced with the ``-batch`` option which automatically exits matlab at the end of the command that is passed 
(`see here for details <https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlablinux.html>`__). 
So the last command from the slurm script above for Matlab r2019a will look like::

    srun matlab -nojvm -nosplash -batch "serial_Matlab($n,$m);"


Running Matlab Array jobs
-------------------------

The most common way to utilize Matlab is to write a single .M-file that
can be used to run tasks as a non-interactive batch job. These jobs are
then submitted as independent tasks and when the heavy part is done, the
results are collected for analysis. For these kinds of jobs the Slurm
array jobs is the best choice; :doc:`For more information on array jobs see
Array jobs in the Triton user guide</triton/tut/serial>`.

Here is an example of testing multiple mutation rates for a genetic algorithm.
First, the matlab code.

.. literalinclude:: /triton/examples/multilang/matlab/serial.m
   :language: MATLAB

We run this code with the following slurm script using ``sbatch``

.. literalinclude:: /triton/examples/multilang/matlab/serial.sh
   :language: slurm

**Collecting the results**

Finally a wrapper script to read in the .mat files and plots the resulting values

.. literalinclude:: /triton/examples/multilang/matlab/collectResults.m
   :language: MATLAB


Seeding the random number generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that by default MATLAB always initializes the random number
generator with a constant value. Thus if you launch several matlab
instances e.g. to calculate distinct ensembles, then you need to seed
the random number generator such that it's distinct for each
instance. In order to do this, you can call the ``rng()`` function,
passing the value of ``$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`` to it.

.. include:: ../examples/matlab/parpool_parallel.rst

Parallel matlab in exclusive mode
---------------------------------
::

    #!/bin/bash -l
    #SBATCH --time=00:15:00
    #SBATCH --exclusive
    #SBATCH -o parallel_Matlab3.out

    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$(nproc)

    module load matlab/r2017b
    matlab_multithread -nosplash -r "parallel_Matlab3($OMP_NUM_THREADS) ; exit(0)"

parallel\_Matlab3.m::

    function parallel_Matlab3(n)
            % Try-catch expression that quits the Matlab session if your code crashes
            try
                    % Initialize the parallel pool
                    c=parcluster();
                    % Ensure that workers don't overlap with other jobs on the cluster
                    t=tempname()
                    mkdir(t)
                    c.JobStorageLocation=t;
                    parpool(c,n);
                    % The actual program calls from matlab's example.
                    % The path for r2017b
                    addpath(strcat(matlabroot, '/examples/distcomp/main'));
                    % The path for r2016b
                    % addpath(strcat(matlabroot, '/examples/distcomp'));
                    pctdemo_aux_parforbench(10000,100,n);
            catch error
                    getReport(error)
                    disp('Error occured');
                    exit(0)
            end
    end

Hints for Condor users
----------------------

The above example also works (even nicer way) for condor.

**A wrapper script to execute matlab on the department workstation.**

::

    #!/bin/bash -l
    # a wrapper to run Matlab with condor
    block=$1
    pointsPerBlock=10
    totalBlocks=10
    matlab -nojvm -r "run($block,$pointsPerBlock,$totalBlocks)"

**Condor submission script**

Condor actually contains ArrayJob functionality that makes the task
easier. ::

    ## Condor submit description (script) file for my_program.exe.
    ## 1. Specify the [path and] name for the executable file...
    Executable = run.sh
    ## 2. Specify Condor execution environment.
    Universe = vanilla
    notify   = Error
    ## 3. Specify remote execution machines running Linux (required)...
    Requirements = ((OpSys == "Linux") || (OpSysName == "Ubuntu"))
    ## 4. Define input files and arguments
    #Input = stdin.txt.$(Process)
    Arguments = $(Process)
    ## 5. Define output/error/log files
    Output = log/stdout.$(Process).txt
    Error  = log/stderr.$(Process).txt
    Log    = log/log.$(Process).txt
    ## 6. Tell Condor which files need to be transferred and when.
    Transfer_input_files = run.m
    Transfer_output_files = output-$(Process).mat
    Transfer_executable = true
    Should_transfer_files = YES
    When_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
    ## 7. Add 10 copies of the job to the queue
    Queue 10


FAQ / troubleshooting
---------------------

If things randomly don't work, you can try removing or moving either the
``~/.matlab`` directory or ``~/.matlab/Rxxxxy`` directory to see if it's
caused by configuration.

Random error messages about things not loading and/or something
(Matlab Live Editor maybe) doesn't work: ``ls *.m``, do you have any
unexpected files like ``pathdef.m`` in there?  Remove them.

Also, check your home quota.  Often ``.matlab`` gets large and fills up
your home directory.  Check the answer at the very top of the page,
under "Matlab Configuration".
