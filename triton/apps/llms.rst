LLMs
====

Large-language models (LLMs) are AI models that can understand and generate
text, primarily using transformer architectures. They are extensively used for tools and 
tasks such as chatbots, translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, and question answering.

This page is about running LLMs on Aalto Triton. As a prerequisite, it is recommended to
get familiar with the basics of using the cluster, including running jobs and using Python (:ref:`tutorials`).

.. note::

    If at any point something doesn't work, you are unsure how to get started or proceed, do not hesitate to contact :doc:`the Aalto RSEs </rse/index>`.

HuggingFace Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to use pre-trained open-source LLMs is to access them through HuggingFace and to leverage their `ðŸ¤— Transformers Python library <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index>`__. 

HuggingFace provides a wide range of tools and pre-trained models, making it easy to integrate and utilize these models in your projects.

You can explore their offerings at `ðŸ¤— HuggingFace <https://huggingface.co/>`__.

.. note::

  We are keeping an eye on the latest models and have pre-downloaded some of them for you. If you need any other models, please contact :doc:`the Aalto RSEs </rse/index>`.

  Run command ``ls /scratch/shareddata/dldata/huggingface-hub-cache/hub`` to see the full list of all the available models.

Below is an example of how to use the ðŸ¤— Transformers `pipeline() <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.49.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline>`__ to load a pre-trained model and use it for question answering.


Example: Question Answering
---------------------------

In the following sbatch script, we request computational resources, load the necessary modules, and run a Python script that uses a HuggingFace model for question answering.

  .. code-block:: bash
  
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --time=00:30:00
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
    #SBATCH --mem=40GB
    #SBATCH --gpus=1
    #SBATCH --output huggingface.%J.out
    #SBATCH --error huggingface.%J.err

    # Set HF_HOME to /scratch/shareddata/dldata/huggingface-hub-cache
    module load model-huggingface

    # Load Python environment to use HuggingFace Transformers
    module load scicomp-llm-env

    # Force transformer to load model(s) from local hub instead of download and load model(s) from remote hub. 
    export TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1
    export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1

    python your_script.py

The `your_script.py` Python script uses a HuggingFace model `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` for conversations and instructions.

.. code-block:: python

  from transformers import pipeline
  import torch

  # Initialize pipeline
  pipe = pipeline( 
    "text-generation", # Task type 
    model="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", # Model name 
    device="cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu", # Use GPU if available 
    max_new_tokens=1000 
  ) 

  # Prepare prompts
  prompts = ["Continue the following sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8", "What is the meaning of life?"]

  # Generate and print responses
  responses = pipe(prompts) 
  print(responses)

You can look at the `model card <https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1>`__ for more information about the model.


Other Frameworks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While HuggingFace provides a convenient way to access and use LLMs, there are other frameworks available for running LLMs, 
such as `DeepSpeed <https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/inference-tutorial/>`__ and `LangChain <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/local_llms/>`__.

If you need assistance running LLMs in these or other frameworks, please contact :doc:`the Aalto RSEs </rse/index>`.


More examples

AaltoRSE has prepared a repository with miscellaneous examples of using LLMs on Triton. You can find it `here <https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/llm-examples/tree/main/>`__.
