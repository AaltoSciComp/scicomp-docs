Spyder is the Scientific PYthon Development
EnviRonment:\ https://www.spyder-ide.org/

On triton there are two modules that provide Spyder:
- The basic scicomp environment module:  ``module load scicomp-python-env`` or
- The neuroimaging environment module: ``module load neuroimaging``

By loading either module you will get access to Spyder.

Using Spyder on Triton
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use spyder on triton, you will need an xserver on your local machine 
(in order to display the spyder GUI) e.g. `VcXsrv <https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/>`_.
You will further need to connect to triton with X-Forwarding:  
``ssh -X triton.aalto.fi``

Finally, load the module you want to use Spyder from (see above) and run ``spyder``

Use a different environment for Spyder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use python packages which are not part of the module you use spyder from,
it is strongly to suggested to create a virtual environment (e.g. :doc:`e.g. Conda environments <python-conda>`).
Set up the environment with all packages you want to use. After that, the following steps will make spyder use the environment:

1. Activate your environment
2. Run ``python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)`` to get the path to the python interpreter in your environment
3. Deactivate the environment
4. Start Spyder
5. In spyder Navigate to "Tools -> Preferences" and select "Python interpreter".
   Under "Use the following Python Interpreter" enter the path from step 2

That will make Spyder use the created python environment.
