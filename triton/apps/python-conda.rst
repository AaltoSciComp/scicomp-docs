==============================
Environments with Conda
==============================

Conda is a popular package manager that is especially
popular in data science and machine learning communities.

It is commonly used to handle complex requirements of Python
and R packages.

Quick usage guide
*****************

.. _conda-first-time-setup:

First time setup
----------------

You can get conda by loading the ``miniconda``-module:

.. code-block:: bash

  module load miniconda

By default Conda stores installed packages and environments in your home
directory. However, as your home directory has a lower quota, it is a good idea
to tell conda to install packages and environments into your work directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir $WRKDIR/.conda_pkgs
  mkdir $WRKDIR/.conda_envs

  conda config --append pkgs_dirs ~/.conda/pkgs
  conda config --append envs_dirs ~/.conda/envs
  conda config --prepend pkgs_dirs $WRKDIR/.conda_pkgs
  conda config --prepend envs_dirs $WRKDIR/.conda_envs

Now you're all set up to create your first environment.


Creating a simple environment with conda
----------------------------------------

One can install environments from the command line itself, but a better idea
is to write an ``environment.yml``-file that describes the environment.

Below we have a simple :download:`environment.yml </triton/examples/conda/environment.yml>`:

.. literalinclude:: /triton/examples/conda/environment.yml

Now we can use the ``conda``-command to create the environment:

.. code-block:: bash

  module load miniconda
  conda env create --file environment.yml

Once the environment is installed, you can activate it with:

.. code-block:: bash

  source activate conda-example

.. include:: /triton/ref/condaactivate.rst

.. include:: /triton/apps/importantnotes/resetconda.rst 

Understanding the environment file
----------------------------------

Conda environment files are written using YAML syntax.
In an environment file one usually defines the following:

- ``name``: Name of the desired environment.
- ``channels``: Which channels to use for packages.
- ``dependencies``: Which conda and pip packages to install.

Choosing conda channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an environment file is used to create an environment, conda
looks up the list of channels (in descending priority) and it will try to find
the needed packages.

Some of the most popular channels are:

- ``conda-forge``: An open-source channel with over 18k packages.
  Highly recommended for new environments. Most packages in
  ``anaconda``-modules come from here.
- ``defaults``: A channel maintained by
  `Anaconda Inc. <https://www.anaconda.com>`_. Free for non-commercial use.
  Default for anaconda distribution.
- ``r``: A channel of
  `R packages <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/r-language-pkg-docs>`_
  maintained by Anaconda Inc.. Free for non-commercial use.
- ``bioconda``: A community maintained channel of
  `bioinformatics packages <https://bioconda.github.io>`_.
- ``pytorch``: Official channel for `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_, a
  popular machine learning framework.

One can have multiple channels defined like in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /triton/examples/pytorch/pytorch-env.yml


Setting package dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Packages in ``environment.yml`` can have version constraints and version
wildcards. One can also specify pip packages to install after conda-packages
have been installed.

For example, the following
:download:`dependency-env.yml </triton/examples/conda/dependency-env.yml>`
would install a numpy with version higher or equal
than 1.10 using conda and scipy via pip:

.. literalinclude:: /triton/examples/conda/dependency-env.yml

Listing packages in an environment
----------------------------------

To list packages installed in an environment, one can use:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda list


Removing an environment
-----------------------

To remove an environment, one can use:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda env remove --name environment_name

Do remember to deactivate the environment before trying to remove it.

Cleaning up conda cache
-----------------------

Conda uses a cache for downloaded and installed packages. This cache can get
large or it can be corrupted by failed downloads.

In these situations one can use ``conda clean`` to clean up the cache.

- ``conda clean -i`` cleans up the index cache that conda uses to find the packages.
- ``conda clean -t`` cleans up downloaded package installers.
- ``conda clean -p`` cleans up unused packages.
- ``conda clean -a`` cleans up all of the above.


Installing new packages into an environment
-------------------------------------------

Installing new packages into an existing environment can be done with
``conda install``-command. The following command would install ``matplotlib``
from ``conda-forge`` into an environment.

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install --freeze-installed --channel conda-forge matplotlib

Installing packages into an existing environment can be risky: conda uses
channels given from the command line when it determines which channels it
should use for the new packages.

This can cause a situation where installing a new package results in the
removal and reinstallation of multiple packages. Adding the
``--freeze-installed``-flags makes already installed packages safe and by
giving explicitly the channels to use, one can make certain that the new
packages come from the same source.

It is usually a better option to create a new environment with the new
package set as an additional dependency in the ``environment.yml``.
This keeps the environment reproducible.

If you intend on installing packages to existing environment, adding
default channels for the environment can also make installing packages
easier.


Setting default channels for an environment
-------------------------------------------

It is a good idea to store channels used when creating the environment
into a configuration file that is stored within the environment. This makes
it easier to install any missing packages.

For example, one could add ``conda-forge`` into the list of default channels
with:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda config --env --add channels conda-forge

We can check the contents of the configuration file with:

.. code-block:: bash

  cat $CONDA_PREFIX/.condarc


Doing everything faster with mamba
**********************************

`mamba <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_ is a drop-in replacement
for conda that does environment building and solving much faster than conda.

To use it, you either need to install ``mamba``-package from
``conda-forge``-channel or use the ``miniconda``-module.

If you have ``mamba``, you can just switch from using ``conda``-command
to using ``mamba`` and it should work in the same way, but faster.

For example, one could create an environment with:

.. code-block:: bash

  mamba env create --file environment.yml


Motivation for using conda
**************************


When should you use conda?
--------------------------

If you need basic Python packages, you can use pre-installed
``anaconda``-modules. See the :doc:`Python-page <python>` for
more information.

You should use conda when you need to create your own custom environment.


Why use conda? What are its advantages?
---------------------------------------

Quite often Python packages are installed with Pip from the
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>`_. These packages contain
Python code and in many cases some compiled code as well.

However, there are three problems pip cannot solve without additional tools:

1. How do you install multiple separate suites of packages for different use cases?
2. How do you handle packages that depend on some external libraries?
3. How do you make sure that all of the packages have are compatible with each other?

Conda tries to solve these problems with the following ways:

1. Conda creates **environments** where packages are installed. Each
   environment can be activated separately.
2. Conda installs library **dependencies** to the environment with the Python
   packages.
3. Conda uses a **solver engine** to figure out whether packages are compatible
   with each other.

Conda also caches installed packages so doing copies of similar environments
does not use additional space.

One can also use the environment files to make the installation procedure more
reproducible.


Creating an environment with CUDA toolkit
*****************************************

NVIDIA's `CUDA-toolkit <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit>`_ is
needed for working with NVIDIA's GPUs. Many Python frameworks that work on
GPUs need to have a supported CUDA toolkit installed.

Conda is often used to provide the CUDA toolkit and additional libraries such
as cuDNN. However, one should choose the version of the CUDA toolkit based on
what the software requires.

If the package is installed from a conda channel such as ``conda-forge``,
conda will **automatically retreive the correct version of CUDA toolkit**.

If the code requires manual compilation with CUDA, one should check the
advanced documentation on
:doc:`Compiling CUDA code while using conda environmentsÂ¶ </triton/usage/conda-and-cuda>`.

In other cases one can use an environment file like this
:download:`cuda-env.yml </triton/examples/cuda/cuda-env.yml>`:

.. literalinclude:: /triton/examples/cuda/cuda-env.yml

.. _cuda_hint:

.. include:: /triton/examples/cuda/cuda_override_hint.rst


.. include:: /triton/examples/tensorflow/tensorflow_with_conda.rst

If you encounter errors related to CUDA while creating the
environment, do note :ref:`this hint <cuda_hint>` on overriding
CUDA during installation.


.. include:: /triton/examples/pytorch/pytorch_with_conda.rst

If you encounter errors related to CUDA while creating the
environment, do note :ref:`this hint <cuda_hint>` on overriding
CUDA during installation.



Installing numpy with Intel MKL enabled BLAS
********************************************

`NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and other mathematical libaries utilize BLAS
(Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) implementation for speeding up many
operations. Intel provides their own fast BLAS implementation in
Intel MKL (Math Kernel Library). When using Intel CPUs, this library
can give a significant performance boost to mathematical calculations.

One can install this library as the default BLAS by specifying
``blas * mkl`` as a requirement in the dependencies like in this
:download:`mkl-env.yml </triton/examples/conda/mkl-env.yml>`:

.. literalinclude:: /triton/examples/conda/mkl-env.yml

Advanced usage
**************


Finding available packages
--------------------------

Because conda tries to make certain that all packages in an environment
are compatible with each other, there are usually tens of different versions
of a single package.

One can search for a package from a channel with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  mamba search --channel conda-forge tensorflow

This will return a long list of packages where each line looks something like
this::

  tensorflow                     2.8.1 cuda112py39h01bd6f0_0  conda-forge

Here we have:

- The package name (``tensorflow``).
- Version of the package (``2.8.1``).
- Package build version. This version often contains information on:

  - Python version needed by the package (``py39`` or Python 3.9).
  - Other libraries used by the package (``cuda112`` or CUDA 11.2).

- Channel where the package comes from (``conda-forge``).

Checking package dependencies
-----------------------------

One can check package dependencies by adding the ``--info``-flag to the
search command. This can give a lot of output, so it is a good idea to
limit the search to one specific package:

.. code-block:: bash

  mamba search --info --channel conda-forge tensorflow=2.8.1=cuda112py39h01bd6f0_0

The output looks something like this::

  tensorflow 2.8.1 cuda112py39h01bd6f0_0
  --------------------------------------
  file name   : tensorflow-2.8.1-cuda112py39h01bd6f0_0.tar.bz2
  name        : tensorflow
  version     : 2.8.1
  build       : cuda112py39h01bd6f0_0
  build number: 0
  size        : 26 KB
  license     : Apache-2.0
  subdir      : linux-64
  url         : https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/tensorflow-2.8.1-cuda112py39h01bd6f0_0.tar.bz2
  md5         : 35716504c8ce6f685ae66a1d9b084fc7
  timestamp   : 2022-05-21 09:09:53 UTC
  dependencies:
    - __cuda
    - python >=3.9,<3.10.0a0
    - python_abi 3.9.* *_cp39
    - tensorflow-base 2.8.1 cuda112py39he716a45_0
    - tensorflow-estimator 2.8.1 cuda112py39hd320b7a_0

Packages with underscores are meta-packages that should not be added to conda
environment specifications. They will be solved by conda automatically.

Here we can see more info on the package, including its dependencies.

When using mamba, one can also use ``mamba repoquery depends`` to
see the dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

  mamba repoquery depends --channel conda-forge tensorflow=2.8.1=cuda112py39h01bd6f0_0

Output looks something like this::

   Name                     Version Build                 Channel
  âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ
   tensorflow               2.8.1   cuda112py39h01bd6f0_0 conda-forge/linux-64
   __cuda >>> NOT FOUND <<<
   python                   3.9.9   h62f1059_0_cpython    conda-forge/linux-64
   python_abi               3.9     2_cp39                conda-forge/linux-64
   tensorflow-base          2.8.1   cuda112py39he716a45_0 conda-forge/linux-64
   tensorflow-estimator     2.8.1   cuda112py39hd320b7a_0 conda-forge/linux-64

One can also print the full dependency list with
``mamba repoquery depends --tree``. This will produce a really long output.

.. code-block:: bash

  mamba repoquery depends --channel conda-forge tensorflow=2.8.1=cuda112py39h01bd6f0_0

Fixing conflicts between packages
---------------------------------

Usually first step of fixing conflicts between packages is to write a new
environment file and list all required packages in the file as dependencies.
A fresh solve of the environment can often result in a working environment.

Sometimes there is a case where a single package does not have support for a
specific version of Python or specific version of CUDA toolkit. In these cases
it is usually beneficial to give more flexibility to the solver by limiting
the number of specified versions.

One can also use the search commands provided by ``mamba`` to see what
dependencies individual packages have.
