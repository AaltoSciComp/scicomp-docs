Cluster general background knowledge
====================================

The following topics are required background knowledge for productive
use of a remote computer cluster, and not covered in the following
sequence of tutorials.  You should at least browse these to confirm
that you know the basics here.

* The "Shell crash course".  You can :doc:`read it (10-20 min)
  </scicomp/shell>`, watch a `short version (20 min)
  <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__ or `longer version (1 hour)
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESXLbtaxpdI&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nN_tMPgqoUQac9bTjZw8JYc&index=3&t=1402s>`__.
  The shorter options are fine.



Building your skills

As time goes on, computers are getting easier and easier to use.
However, research is not a consumer product, and the fact is that you
need more knowledge to use Triton than most people learn in academic
courses.

We have created a `modular
training plan <https://hands-on.coderefinery.org>`__, which
divides useful knowledge into levels.  In order to use Triton well, you need to be somewhat
proficient at Linux usage (C level).  In order to do parallel work,
you need to be good at the D-level and also somewhat proficient at the
HPC level (E-level).  This tutorial and user guide covers the D-level,
but it is up to you to reach the C-level first.

See our `training program and plan <https://hands-on.coderefinery.org>`__ for
suggested material for self-study and lessons.  We offer routine
training, see our :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice lecture series
</training/scip/index>` page for info.

**You can't learn everything you need all at once.  Instead,
continually learn and know when to ask for help.**
