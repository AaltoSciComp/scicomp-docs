Online work and support
=======================

.. seealso::

   Our garage description page for users: :doc:`/help/garage`.  (This
   is an internal description page)

Since 2020, Aalto Scientific Computing has worked online.  Since we
are a distributed team supporting users in many locations, this has
improved our work in numerous ways.  Online work gives us:

- A way to interact regardless of physical distribution close to users.
- Higher-quality, continuous interaction (including better onboarding).
- Better work-life balance and adaptability to different lifestyles.

Since 2017, we have had weekly office hours called "garage".  Since
2020, they have been online and revolutionized our support.  The garage
gives us:

- A standard way to help users interactively, without the burden of
  scheduling meetings.
- A "social time" in the middle of the workday to chat with each other.
- By combining the above two, we can chat about useful things relevant
  to our work, handle many internal meetings that would otherwise have
  to be scheduled and allows us to better share knowledge, and in
  general provide the spontaneous interaction that everyone claims is
  missing from remote work.



rkdarst's principles of remote work
-----------------------------------

The online garage helps with at least two of rkdarst's principles of
remote work, and part of a third:

- No private messages (allow others to know what you are doing)
- Don't schedule meetings (use standard meeting locations and talk
  spontaneously)
- Work in public (make it possible for others to join you)



How it works: "garage" support session
--------------------------------------

- We have an announced time: **13:00, every workday**.
- Users and staff join the meeting during the scheduled time
- We don't promise any service level - some days, it could be that
  users arrive but there are no staff.  But this has become so
  integral to our work that it never happens.
- Users ask their question and we do initial triage
- We help either in the main room or breakout rooms. (for example,
  main room for a question where there is one user and the topic is a
  good discussion point for everyone on the team)
- At least one staff helps.  Usually, we try to have two helping: one
  who knows and one who is learning the topic.  (This is very useful
  "on the job training".)
- Staff don't have to be always-on.  It is usual for many staff to be
  working on their other work, passively listening in case something
  interesting comes up or someone says their name.
- Staff can also easily be called to the meeting using chat.
- Very low threshold for screensharing.
- "Remote control" is very useful, and a middle ground between telling
  people commands to type (extremely slow and demotivating when
  someone has no idea what to do) and taking over their computer
  (demotivating/hiding information in another way) since the user can
  easily and actively see what is going on.
- Often in other issues, when the actual problem is unclear, we will
  say "Let's talk in garage" rather than try to debug by asynchronous
  chat.  Since garage is so frequent, this feels good.

Technical setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- There is one recurring Zoom meeting
- Meeting schedule = "recurring at no fixed time" option.
- Everyone on our team is a co-host (must be in same Zoom
  organization)
- The first co-host to join becomes the meeting host.
- Any co-host can open breakout rooms or assign customers to breakout
  rooms.  But for the most part we tell users where to go and they go
  themselves.
- Normally, first person to need breakout rooms opens an excess
  number, such as 10, and selects "allow participates to choose", click
  "open", and takes no further management action.
- Some people may initially use chat to ask their question (the
  dispatcher can also send these initial questions by chat).  This is
  especially good as a second conversation while one problem is being
  discussed.
- Zoom trolls have never been a problem, even though the link is
  public.  One hypothesis is that by not listing specific dates on the
  webpage, it is not a findable target by someone looking for "where
  to troll now?".


Typical procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Usually one person is the effective "dispatcher": they make sure
  that everyone is greeted, take a basic description of each problem.
  They make sure that people are handled, call in the best supporter,
  etc.  (after a team gets enough experience, this role becomes
  implicit).



How it works: internal meetings
-------------------------------

- **The garage room is actually our only meeting room for all normal
  team meetings**

  - For example, we have our weekly team meeting right before the
    garage one day of the week.
  - This keeps meetings on schedule and provides a day when we can be
    sure most people are at garage, for the hardest questions
  - We would enable the waiting room towards the ends of these
    meetings (but normally we don't use the waiting room).

- Even other meetings, either two people discussing something, happen
  in this room.

  - Worst case: meetings overlap or run into each other.  **But this
    is actually good**, doesn't everyone complain that you don't
    spontaneously meet people online?  We split to breakout rooms and
    manage.  Sometimes we have even made important connections this
    way.

- This isn't just for users - other staff teams can come talk to us
  during this time.  Basically, it replaces a lot of the overhead with
  any meeting with us.

- Online-default meetings is great for work-life balance of people,
  especially those with families.

- Chat or other asynchronous text-based communication is a requirement
  for inclusive meetings. It allows anyone to contribute ideas without
  waiting for a pause, and more than makes up for any online
  awkwardness.  (The "meeting agenda" below can also serve this purpose).

- Meetings are managed with a Google Docs agenda.

  - Each week, a new heading is made, and it collects topics
    for the next meeting.  There is no running through a list of ongoing
    projects and hearing "going on", every agenda item has been actively
    placed by someone over the last week, who actively needs thoughts
    and a decision from the rest of the team.
  - Someone screenshares the agenda.  Instead of needing to find a
    pause to talk, people can write information/thoughts directly into
    the agenda, so meetings scale better.  People can write
    information already in advance of the meeting, to focus the
    meeting on discussion and not sharing information.
  - Everyone should have the agenda open themselves so they can see,
    scroll, and contribute - a meeting is no longer just voice talking!

    - The meeting agenda can also serve as chat - if someone wants to
      say something but can't find a time to use voice, they right it
      there directly as a point.
    - If you want, you can expect everyone to write down their most
      important points and summaries of their points directly in the
      agenda - themselves (instead of delegating that to a designated
      note-taker).  This is more fair, allows everyone to write their
      notes in their own words, emphasize their most important points
      (unimportant points not written), and gives others a time to
      talk.

  - It is only one running document (not a new one each week).  New
    weeks are added to the top (since top loads first).  Attendees can
    easily scroll down to refer to past weeks.
  - This strategy has revolutionized our meetings.  Other meetings
    have much more of a "this meeting should have been an email"
    feeling after this. (In no small part because the "this should
    have been an email" parts get written and read by everyone, with
    only a short mention if that's all it needs).



How it works: general common space
----------------------------------

- If two people are text-chatting and need to talk in person, there is
  zero overhead.  One simply asks "Zoom now?", the other confirms, and
  they know exactly where to go.  Or the answer might be "Garage
  tomorrow?"
- This space is also is used for random coffee breaks, etc, which are
  usually spontaneously announced.
- In theory, especially when we are onboarding people, this can be a
  generic hangout space during downtime.  You might meet someone there
  and chat and learn something.
- In short, the meeting is the "commons" of "caves and commons".



Problems with in-person office hours / garage
---------------------------------------------

- People have to bring their own laptop.  When someone works on a
  power desktop, they can't bring it.

- No screen-sharing.  People are crowded around one computer looking
  at it.

  - You can't type on their computer without taking it away from
    them.  For screen sharing, if you do "remote control" at least
    they can clearly see and feel in control.
  - Really hard to have multiple supporters with one customer.
  - From your main workspace, you hopefully have multiple screens.
    One screen can be the screenshare while the other is your own
    debugging/testing work.

- For individual-person office hours, or even an open office policy,
  someone may come by and the best person to answer may not be there,
  may be in another building, etc.

  - Even if they are there, one-on-one support doesn't give the
    "on-the-job training" to other team members.

- "Open door policy" makes for constant distractions.

- In-person garage tends to be limited to once a week, since everyone
  has to go there.  Staff leave their main workspace, so can't work as
  efficiently.  Online, it is completely reasonable to be working on
  other work while muted/video off and passively listening in case
  something useful comes up.



Open questions
--------------

- What is the largest size team for which this works?  What happens
  when we go over that?
- What's the best frequency?  *We really think that every day works
  best for something within a team.*
- Mixing different teams in general: how different of teams can use
  the same garage/standard meeting room.
- If multiple teams have separate garages, should they be at the same
  time or different?  Combined?  (does it get too big?)

  - Is it even possible for one person to have multiple garages they
    need to keep in their mind - or is it a "one-per-person" kind of
    thing?

- How many garages can someone attend before it becomes "too much".
- Is there a better tech than Zoom?  In 2022, it works much better
  than early 2021, and at least people can join via browser.
- When people start working in-office again, how does this continue?
  (People have started, and Garage seems to be a permanent culture
  shift.  But it helps that our offices are distributed around).



The future
----------

- Coordinated garages across different teams?  At the same time or
  different?
- Some sort of cross-organization garage sessions.  But, is something
  only once a week good enough to support continuous work?  Does it
  work as a starting point, then you direct the user to your own
  specific daily garage?



Recommendations for how to implement your garage
------------------------------------------------

(I'm not sure what to say here, that isn't already said or implied
above.  Any ideas?)

- Why the name?

  - I think it came from another Aalto team that held a "travel
    garage".  Unsure where they got the name from or if there is a
    better name.
