.. admonition:: Planned disruptions
   :class: important

   * There are no current planned disruptions in the daily garage.


If you need more help than the issue trackers, this is the place to
be.  It's not just Triton, but all aspects of scientific computing.

Come if you want to:

-  Solve problems
-  Discuss and figure out what your problem really is
-  Brainstorm the best strategy are for your problems
-  Work with someone on your issues in real time
-  Network with others who are doing similar work and learn something
   new

What kind of issues can we help with:

- Code and Software:

  - Issues with your code or software tools you use (e.g. debugging, setting up software, linking libraries)
  - Code parallelization
  - Code versioning, git, testing

- Data Management:

  - Data management plans, data sharing
  - Handling of sensitive data and general legal and ethical (to some extent) questions about research data
  - Workflows for big datasets
  - Data versioning

- Triton cluster:

  - Slurm job submissions
  - Cluster usage
  - Script setup
  - Module management / Library loading

- General:

  - Basic methodological or statistical issues

Notes:

* All garages are designed for researchers and staff working in Aalto (or those who have a need to contact us).

* You don't have to have a specific question, you can come by just to
  chat, listen, or figure out if you should have a question.

* You can also :ref:`chat with us <chat>` any other time (no promises
  on reply time, though).

Triton, SciComp, RSE, and CS
----------------------------

.. admonition:: Link

   https://aalto.zoom.us/j/61322268370, every workday at 13:00

You can meet us online, every workday, at 13:00, `online via zoom
<https://aalto.zoom.us/j/61322268370>`__.  Imagine this like walking
into our office to ask for help. Even if you are not sure whether we can help you, come
and chat with us anyway and we can figure it out.


* This doesn't replace email or the `Triton issue
  tracker
  <https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`__
  for clearly-defined tasks.  Garage is good for discussion,
  brainstorming, and deciding the best path.   If in doubt, come to
  garage and we will help you decide.  Many people make an issue, then
  come to garage to discuss.

* Try to arrive between 13:00 - 13:15.  We may leave early if there is
  no one around.  Please don't arrive early since we have other
  meetings then.

* We have some **special days** (see list below) to ask about specific
  topics, but in reality we can answer any question any day.

* Join on Zoom via https://aalto.zoom.us/j/61322268370 .



NBE/PHYS
--------

PHYS, NBE, and ITS (Aalto IT Services) staff are part of the Garage sessions every **Monday and Wednesday**.
Regular reminders are sent to the department personnel lists.



Special days
------------

Some days are special, and have extra staff about certain topics.  But
you can always visit on any day and ask any question, and we can
usually give a good answer (especially about Triton, HPC, computing,
software, and data).

* **Mondays** also have NBE/PHYS IT present.
* **Tuesdays**
* **Wednesdays** also have NBE/PHYS IT present.
* **Thursdays**
* **Fridays** also have CS IT present (at the beginning).



Others
------

Aalto IT services runs something similar `for some other schools and
departments
<https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/new-service-for-researchers-it-support-via-zoom>`__.



In person
---------

In-person garages haven't been held since early 2020 for the obvious
reason.  The online garage above is more frequent and you are more
likely to meet the very best person for your topic.
