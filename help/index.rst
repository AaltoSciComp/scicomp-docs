Help
====

There are many ways to get help with your scientific computing and
data needs - in fact, so many you don't know what to use.  This page
lists how to ask for help, for different kinds of needs.

Formulate your question
-----------------------

We get many requests for help which are too vague to give a useful
response, so we delay while we try to find something better than
"please explain more", which slows everything down.  So, when sending
us a question, always try to clarify these points to get the fastest
solution:

* **Has it ever worked?**  (If so, what has changed?)
* **What are you trying to accomplish?**  (Your `ultimate goal
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem>`__, not current technical
  obstacle.)
* **What did you do?**  (Be specific enough to be reproducible - copy and
  paste exact commands you run, exact output messages, scripts, inputs, etc.)
* **What do you need?**  Do you need a complete solution, pointers to
  get started, or should we say if it will take too long and we
  recommend you think of other solutions first?

If you don't know something, it's OK, just explain the best you can
and we'll go from there!  You can also chat with us to brainstorm
about issues in general, which helps to figure out these questions.  A
much more detailed guide is available from `Sigma2 documentation
<https://documentation.sigma2.no/getting_help/how_to_write_good_support_requests.html>`__.

We don't need a long story in the first message - we'll ask for more
later.  Try to cover these points, and we are happy to get your
message.



Aalto Scientific Computing
--------------------------

computing and data, and mostly
consist of PhD-level researchers so we can understand what you are
doing, too.  Our main focus areas are
**high-performance computing** (:doc:`Triton </triton/index>`),
**research software** (:doc:`RSEs </rse/index>`), **data**, and
**training** :doc:`training </training/index>`.

* Problems with Triton, using Triton
* Help with software on Triton
* Data advice, FAIR data, confidential data, data organization
* Suggestions on tools and workflows to use
* General research software and research tools
* Advice on other Aalto services
* Advice on using CSC services
* Triton Accounts (by email)
* Increasing quotas, requesting group storage space (by email)

Website
~~~~~~~

Search this website for help.  For that matter, also search the
internet in usual.  This is usually a good place to start, but often
you need to move on to the next steps.

.. _issuetracker-general:

Triton Issue tracker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Triton issue tracker
<https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`__,
which is where all Triton issues should go.  *Log in and search the issue
tracker for related issues, you may find the solution already*

**If you issue is about or related to Triton this is where it should go.**

Garage
~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Link

   https://aalto.zoom.us/j/61322268370, every day at 13:00

Daily :doc:`SciComp Garage sessions </help/garage>`, where you can
informally chat.  This is especially useful when your question is not yet
fully defined, or you think that demonstrating the problem for
immediate feedback is useful.

.. _chat:

Chat
~~~~

Chat can be a great way to quickly talk with others, share tips, and
quickly get feedback on if a problem is large or small, something to
get help with or figure out yourself, etc.  For longer solutions, we will
direct you to the issue trackers but it rarely hurts to do a real-time
discussion.  (For real-time video chat with screen sharing, come to
the garage above).

The `SciComp Zulipchat, scicomp.zulip.cs.aalto.fi
<https://scicomp.zulip.cs.aalto.fi>`__ is where we most often hang
out.  You can ask triton questions in ``#triton``, general questions
in ``#general``, research software engineering questions in ``#rse``,
etc.  The main point of Zulip is **topics**, which allow you to
name threads and easily follow old information. (:doc:`use zulip in your
courses </aalto/zulip>`)

You can also chat with us on `Aalto Microsoft Teams
<https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a688ad82e41aa46d48ad978aea767419c%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=4089981d-a443-493d-ae3e-3df5c63caed6&tenantId=ae1a7724-4041-4462-a6dc-538cb199707e>`__.
The invite code is ``e50tyij``.  Our staff also hang out on other
department chats.

Research Software Engineer service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, a problem goes beyond "Triton support" and becomes
"scientific computing support".  Our :doc:`Research Software Engineers
</rse/index>` are perfect for these kinds of problems: they can
program with you, set up your workflow, or even handle all the
technical problems for you.  Contact via the other contact methods on
this page, especially via the garage.

Email
~~~~~

* scicomp at aalto.fi.  Use this only for things related to your
  account (requesting a Triton account), quota, etc. - most other
  things go to the tracker above.

* rse-group at aalto.fi: Research software engineering service
  requests. (it's usually better to drop by :ref:`SciComp garage
  <garage>` since we usually need to discuss more.)



Department IT
-------------

CS, NBE, and PHYS have their own IT groups (among others, but those
are the Science-IT departments with the most support).  They handle
local matters and can reliably direct you to the right resources.
Department IT handles:

* Computers, laptops, personal devices
* Department data storage spaces
* Other department-managed tools and services

Reach them by department-specific email addresses

NBE and PHYS IT use the same email issue tracker (esupport) as Aalto
IT, so issues can be exchanged no matter which address you send an
issue to.  CS uses a different one, so you have to think a bit more
before sending something.



Community
---------

In addition to formal support, there is are informal activities, too:

* The daily :doc:`SciComp Garage </help/garage>`, designed to provide
  one-on-one help, but we invite anyone to come, hang out in the main
  room, and network with us.  This is for basic help and brainstorming.

* Subscribe to notifications from the `Triton issue tracker
  <https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`__
  even if you don't post there.  You will learn a lot.

* Sign up for the `Research software engineers and powerusers mailing
  list <https://list.aalto.fi/mailman/listinfo/rse>`__ and learn about
  more events that interest you.  This isn't the place to ask for
  basic help, but if you hang out here you will learn a *lot*.



Other groups at Aalto
---------------------

servicedesk, Aalto IT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

servicedesk()aalto.fi is the general IT Services service desk.  They
can handle things with account, devices, and so on.  They have a wide
range of responsibilities, but don't always know about local resources
that may be more appropriate for your needs.  There is an "IT Services
for Research" group which focuses on research needs

For students (who aren't also researchers), this is always your first
point of contact - in addition to your teacher.

servicedesk handles:

* Aalto accounts, passwords (including Triton passwords)
* University-wide data storage (work, teamwork, home directories)
* All university-wide common IT infrastructure: wifi, network,
  devices, websites, learning platforms, etc.
* Anything department stuff, when you are not in a department with
  local IT staff.

Reach them by:

* `Email or phone <https://www.aalto.fi/en/node/109031/>`__
* Browse the `IT Services for Research list
  <https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/it-services-for-research>`__



Research services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aalto `Research Services
<https://www.aalto.fi/en/service-entities/research-and-innovation-services>`__
function more as project administrative services rather than close
research support.  They provide important help for:

* Data management plans for funding applications, other
  openscience-level data-related questions, and Open Science (contact
  researchdata@aalto.fi)
* Legal or ethical advice, making contracts and NDAs.
* Library services
* Applying for funding and administering it.

In many cases, you can chat with Aalto Scientific Computing and we can
give some initial practical advice and direct you to the right
Research Services resources.

Reach research services by:

* Contacting service email addresses at the link above
* Contacting school representatives findable at the link above
* researchdata@aalto.fi for data-related things
