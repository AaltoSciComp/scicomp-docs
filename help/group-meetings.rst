Group meetings
==============

This page applies to these departments so far: **CS, NBE, PHYS** (if
others want to join, let us know).

We would like to meet with each research group once a year.  This
isn't to advertise stuff to you, but to hear what you all need but
can't get, so that we can help you with that.  A group meeting
consists of your group plus other technical services staff
(Science-IT, CS-IT, etc.) which are relevant for your group's work.
Hopefully, we can immediately solve some of your major problems.  Your
group will come away better able to use the best possible services,
and we will come away knowing what to focus on in the next year.



Practical matters
-----------------

Ideally, someone (Science-IT, CS-IT, etc.) contacts your group leader
to arrange a time.  On the other hand, **contact your most local
(department) anytime to arrange a group meeting** - we are always
happy for an eager audience.  Your local support will request all the
other relevant parties to be there.

The group meeting would happen whenever is most convenient for you -
for example, during your regular group meetings.  **Please propose the
best times for you**.  One hour is sufficient.

**You don't need any particular preparation**.  If you do anything,
think about what computational/data/software tools you use and what
problems you have - you could have one or a few people tell about
the typical workflows of the group.



Who we are, what we do
----------------------

We are **Technical services** (in particular ones focused on
computing).  See the rest of scicomp.aalto.fi for the types of things
we support.  :doc:`/aalto/welcomeresearchers` tells our most important
services for you (+ the most important ones by others at Aalto).

Also at Aalto, you also have these other major service units which are
relevant to you (this meeting isn't mainly about them, but we have
inside knowledge of IT Services so can help there):

* IT Services (ITS): General mass-consumption IT services for all Aalto.
* Research services: applying for grants, administrating, legal, etc.
* Learning services: teaching
* Communication services
* Finance
* HR

* Stories from the field: how do *you* do your work?
* Feedback: How do you do your work now?  What works well?  What
  doesn't work well?  What do you need in the future?  **Tell us all
  your complaints**, because we can't work on the right things without
  them. (long)



News / topical items, 2022
